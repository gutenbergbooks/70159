<small>THE CHILDREN KNOCK.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">EARLY in the morning of an autumnal day,
when the morning mist lay upon the ground,
two children, a boy and a girl of six and seven
years old, went hand in hand through the back, or
garden path, out of the village. The girl appeared
the oldest, and carried slate, books, and a writing-book
under her arm; the boy had the same in a
gray linen satchel, which was slung over his shoulder.
The girl wore a cap of white drill that reached
only to the forehead, and made the full arch of
her brow the more conspicuous. The boy was
bareheaded. The footstep of the boy only could
be heard, for he had strong shoes on his feet; but
the girl was barefoot. Where the path permitted,
the children went close together; but, when the
hedges made it too narrow, the girl always went
first.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>Upon the yellow leaves of the shrubbery lay a
white frost, and the berries of the hawthorn, the
tall stems of the wild brier, looked as though they
were silvered over. The sparrows in the hedges
twitter and fly in uneasy flocks close to the children,
then light again not far from them, twittering
and chirping, till at length they fly to a garden,
where they light upon an apple-tree, so that the
dry leaves rustle, and fall to the ground. A magpie
flies quickly up from the path across the fields,
and then rests upon the great pear-tree, where
the ravens still cawed. This magpie must have
told them a secret, for the ravens flew up and
crossed over the tree, and an old one let himself
down upon the topmost wavering branch, while
the others found for themselves, upon the lower
branches, good places, where they could rest and
look out. They appeared to desire to know why
the children, with their school-books, struck into
the side street, and wandered out of the village.
One of the ravens flew like a scout, or spy, and
placed himself upon a stunted willow by the fish-pond.
But the children went quietly on their
way by the alders near the pond, till they came
out again into the street; then crossed to the other
side of the street where stood a small, low house.
The house is entirely closed, and the children
stand at the door and knock softly. Then the
girl calls courageously, “Father! Mother!” and
the boy timidly repeats, “Father! Mother!” At<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
length the girl seizes the door-latch, and presses
it softly up; the boards rustle and she listens, but
nothing comes. Now she ventures in quicker
strokes to press the latch up and down, but only
the sound echoes from the deserted house. No
human voice answers. The boy places his lips
upon a crack in the door and calls again, “Father!
Mother!” Inquiringly he looks up to his sister;
and when he looks down again his breath upon
the door-latch has become hoar-frost.</p>

<p>From the mist-covered village sound the measured
strokes of the thresher; now rapid and loud,
falling confusedly, and now with slow and wearied
strokes; then again clear and vivid; then stifled
and hollow. The children stand as though bewildered.
At length they cease to call and knock,
and sit down upon scattered logs of wood. These
lay piled around the stem of a mountain-ash,
overshadowing the side of the house, and now
ornamented with its red autumn berries. The
children rivet their eyes upon the door of the
house; but all remains silent and closed.</p>

<p>“Father brought this wood from Moosbrunnenwood,”
said the girl, pointing to the log upon
which she was sitting; then she added, with a
wise look, “it gives good warmth, and there is
a great deal of rosin in it that burns like a torch,
but it costs a great deal to split it.”</p>

<p>“If I was grown up,” said the boy, “I would
take father’s great axe and the two iron wedges<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
and split it into pieces as smooth as glass, and I
would make a beautiful pile of it, like that of the
coal-burner Mathew, in the forest; and then when
father comes home he will be glad, and he will
say, ‘Who did that?’ Don’t you dare to tell
him,” and he pointed his finger threateningly at
his sister.</p>

<p>The latter appeared to have a dawning perception
that it would be of no use to wait for father
and mother, and she cast a melancholy glance at
the boy; and then, looking at his shoes, she said,
“Then you must also put on father’s boots. But
come, we will skip stones in the lake, and see if I
can throw farther than you; and, as we go, I will
give you a riddle to guess. What wood is that
which warms without burning?”</p>

<p>“The master’s ruler when the palms catch it,”
said the boy.</p>

<p>“No, I don’t mean that. The wood that they
split makes one warm without burning it.” When
standing by the hedge she asked, “It sits upon a
little stem, hath a little red coat, and its belly is
full of stones. What may that be?”</p>

<p>The boy knit his brows and cried out, “Hush!
Don’t tell me what it is. It is a hip-berry.”</p>

<p>The girl nodded applause, and made a face as
though she told him the riddle for the first time,
whereas she had often told it before to divert him
from sorrow.</p>

<p>The sun had now scattered the fog, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
little valley came out in clear shining sunlight
as the children turned towards the pond and
began to make the flat stones dance through the
water.</p>

<p>In passing, the girl lifted the latch again many
times, but the door did not open, and nothing
appeared at the window. They soon played, full
of joy and laughter, at the pond, and the girl
seemed especially glad that her brother was
always the most skilful, and, beating her at the
sport, he became wholly gay. She, indeed, made
herself less skilful than she really was, for her
stones plumped, at the first throw, deep into the
water, at which the boy laughed loud. In the
zeal of their sport, both children forgot where they
were, and why they had come there, and yet to
both it was melancholy and strange.</p>

<p>In that house, now so silent and closed, had
dwelt for some time back Josenhans, with his wife
and two children, Amrie (Anna Maria) and Dami
(Damian). The father was a wood-cutter in the
forest, but also handy at any work; for the house
which he had purchased in a neglected condition,
he had repaired himself, and wholly covered in the
roof. In the autumn he intended to whiten the
wall of the interior. The chalk for that purpose
was lying in a pit covered with brushwood. His
wife was one of the best workwomen in the village.
Day and night, in sorrow and in joy, she
was a helper to every one; always willing, always<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
ready, for she had early taught her children,
especially Amrie, to take care of themselves.
Industry, contentment, and domestic competency
made the house one of the happiest in the village.
An insidious illness prostrated the mother, and the
next evening the father also, and after a few days
two coffins were borne on the same evening from
the humble house. The children were taken into
one of the neighbor’s houses during the illness of
their parents, and they learnt their death only on
Monday, when they were dressed in their Sunday
clothes, to follow in the funeral procession.</p>

<p>Neither Josenhans nor his wife had relations in
the place, and yet loud weeping and praise of the
dead were heard at the grave; and the Mayor of
the village led both children by the hand, as all
three followed in the procession. At the grave
both children were still and quiet; they were even
cheerful, although they often asked, “Where were
their father and mother?” They ate at the table
of the Mayor, and everybody was kind to them.
When they left the table, they received little tarts
wrapped in paper to take with them.</p>

<p>As the evening came on, the Mayor ordered
a man of the name of Krappenzacher to take Dami
home with him, and a woman, called Brown Mariann,
to take care of Amrie; but now the children
would not be separated. They wept aloud, and
insisted upon being taken to their parents. Dami,
at length, was coaxed by false pretences, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
Amrie could not be forced to leave her brother.
At length the foreman of the Mayor took her in
his arms and carried her, by main strength, to the
house of Brown Mariann. There she found her
own bed from the parents’ house; but she would
not lie down upon it, and wept herself to sleep
upon the floor, when they laid her all dressed as
she was upon her bed. Dami was also heard
weeping and screaming aloud, but soon he was
still. The much defamed Brown Mariann showed
this evening how considerate and tender she was
for the orphan intrusted to her care. For many
years she had been bereft of her children, and as
she stood by the sleeping girl she said in a low
voice, “Ah! happy sleep of childhood; it weeps
and instantly falls asleep without the twilight of
hope, without the anxiety of dreams.” She sighed
deeply.</p>

<p>The next morning, early, Amrie went to dress
her brother and to console him for what had
happened. “As soon as father comes back,”
she said, “he will take you home and pay the
Krappenzacher.” Then both the children went
out to the parental house, knocked on the door and
wept aloud.</p>

<p>At length Mathew, the coal-burner, who lived
near, came and carried them both to school. He
asked the schoolmaster to make the children
understand that their parents were dead, for
Amrie especially appeared incapable of believing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
it. The teacher did all that was possible, and
they became more quiet and resigned. But from
the school they went again to the parents’ house,
and waited there, hungry and thirsty, till some
compassionate person carried them away.</p>

<p>The person who had a mortgage upon the
Josenhans house took it, and the payment which
Josenhans had already made was lost; for, according
to the custom of the village, whatever had
been paid was forfeited. There were many houses
in the village beside the Josenhans that remained
untenanted. All the possessions of their parents
were sold, and a small sum obtained for the children,
but not sufficient to pay their board. Thus
they became parish orphans, and were of course
boarded with those who would take them at the
lowest price.</p>

<p>Amrie informed her brother one day with delight,
that she had found out where the cuckoo
clock of their parents was. Mathew, the coal-burner,
had bought it; in the evening they went
and stood near the house and waited till the clock
cried <i>cuckoo</i>,—then they looked at each other and
laughed.</p>

<p>The children continued every morning to go to
their parents’ house, knock at the door, call and
wait. Then they played at the fish-pond, as we
have seen them to-day. Afterwards they listened
to a call which they used not to hear at this season
of the year, for the cuckoo at Mathew’s called
eight times.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>“We must to the school,” said Amrie, and hastened
with her brother through the garden paths
into the village. As they passed behind the barn
of Farmer Rodel, Dami said, “Our guardian has
had a great deal of threshing done to-day,” and he
pointed to the straw that hung as a trophy over
the half door of the barn. Amrie nodded silently.</p>

<small>THE FAR-OFF SPIRIT.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">FARMER RODEL, whose house, ornamented
with red striped beams, and a pious sentence,
enclosed in the form of a heart, stood not far from
the Josenhans dwelling, had himself appointed by
the Mayor, guardian of the orphan children. His
guardianship consisted in nothing more than in
preserving the unsold clothes of their father, and
when he met or passed one of the children in
the street he would ask, “Have you clothes
enough?” and, without waiting to be answered,
he would pass on. Yet the children felt a strange
pride in having that great farmer called their
guardian. They often stood by the great house
and looked longingly at it, as though they expected
something, they knew not what, and they
sat often down by the ploughs and harrows at the
corner of the shed and read over again and again
the pious sentence on the house. The house spoke
to them if all others were silent.</p>

<p>The Sunday before <i>All Souls</i>, the children
played again before their parents’ deserted house.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
They seemed, as it were, banished to this place.
There came along the wife of Farmer Landfried
from the Hochdorfer Road. She had a red silk
umbrella under her arm and a dark hymn-book in
her hand. She had come to make her last visit
in the place of her birth. Yesterday, her servant in
a four-horse wagon had taken all her furniture out
of the village, and early this morning with her
husband and three children she would move to
their lately purchased estate in the far-off district
of Allgäu. When at some distance she nodded
to the children; but they saw nothing but the
melancholy expression upon the face of the woman.
As she now stood by them she said, “God bless
you, children! what do you do here? to whom do
you belong?”</p>

<p>“To the Josenhans,” answered Amrie, pointing
towards the house.</p>

<p>“Oh! you poor children,” she cried, striking
her hands together; “I should have known you,
lass! exactly so did your mother look, when we
went to school together. We were good comrades
and friends, and your father worked with my
cousin, Farmer Rodel. I know all about you—but
tell me, Amrie, why have you no shoes on? You
will take cold in this wet weather. Say to Mariann
that Farmer Landfried’s wife, from Hochdorf,
said it was not right to let you run about in this
manner; no—you need say nothing. I will speak
to her. But, Amrie, you must now be sensible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
and prudent, and take care of yourself. Think of
it—what if thy mother knew that in this time of
the year you went about barefoot!”</p>

<p>The child looked earnestly at the woman as
though she would say, “Does not my mother then
know it?”</p>

<p>“Ah, that is the worst of it,” she said, answering
the thought of the child, “that you can never know
what good and honest people your parents were;
<i>that</i> must elder people tell you. Think of it,
Amrie, that it will make your parents happy in
heaven when they hear people say, ‘There are the
Josenhans children, they are a proof of all goodness.
There they see plainly the blessing of good
and honest parents.’”</p>

<p>At these last words big tears ran down the
cheeks of the farmer’s wife. Painful emotions (that
had, indeed, a wholly different source), at these
thoughts and words, made them continue to flow.
She laid her hand upon the head of the girl, who,
at the sight of her tears, began to weep violently.
She felt that a good soul had turned towards her,
and a dawning belief that her parents were really
lost became clearer to her.</p>

<p>The countenance of the women suddenly lighted.
She raised her eyes filled with tears to heaven and
said, “<i>Thou</i>, good God, has sent this thought to
me!” Then she turned to the child and said,
“Listen! I will take you with me! My Lisbeth
was taken from me at your age. Speak! will you
go with me to Allgäu, and always remain with me?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>“Yes,” said Amrie, resolutely.</p>

<p>She felt herself seized from behind, and a slight
blow upon her shoulder.</p>

<p>“You dare not,” said Dami, embracing her, and
trembling from head to foot.</p>

<p>“Be quiet,” said Amrie, “the good lady will take
you also. Is it not so?” she said, timidly. “My
Dami may go with us?”</p>

<p>“No, child, that cannot be; I have boys enough
at home.”</p>

<p>“Then I must remain here,” said Amrie, and
took hold of her brother’s hand.</p>

<p>There is sometimes in the soul an emotion where
fever and frost contend. It has been so with the
stranger, and now she looked upon the child with
a species of relief. Through strong emotion, and
influenced by the purest benevolence, she would
have undertaken a duty whose significance and
difficulty she had not sufficiently considered; and
especially as she did not know how her husband
would take it. Now, as the child herself refused,
there intervened a sufficient reason; all was clear
again, and she turned quickly from the duty. She
had satisfied her heart by proposing it, and now
that the objection came not from herself, she had a
kind of satisfaction in having <i>offered</i>, without herself
taking back her word.</p>

<p>“As you please,” said the stranger; “I will not
urge you. Who knows? perhaps it would be better
that you should grow up first. It is well to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
learn to suffer in youth; the good comes easier
after we have learnt the evil. Be only honest and
good, and never forget that, on account of your
parents, as long as God spares my life you shall
have a shelter with me. Remember, if it does not
go well with you, that you are not left alone in the
world. Think of the wife of Farmer Landfried, in
Zusmarshofen, in Allgäu. A word more. Don’t
say in the village that I would have taken you.
It is the way with people—they would blame
you because you did not go—but it is as well so.
Wait, I will give you something to remember me
by.” She sought in her pocket, then suddenly
putting her hand to her neck she drew out a five
stringed garnet necklace, to which there was fastened
a Swedish ducat, and, throwing the ornament
over the neck of the child, she kissed her. Amrie
looked as one enchanted upon all these proceedings.
“For thee, alas! I have nothing,” she said
to Dami, who stood with a little switch in his hand
which he continued to break into small pieces;
“but I will send you a pair of leather trousers of
my John’s—they are not entirely new, but you
can wear them when you are taller. Now God
protect you, dear children! If it is possible I will
come to see you again, Amrie. In the mean time
send Mariann to me in the church. Remember
always to be good, pray constantly for your parents,
and never forget that you have a protector in
heaven and also upon earth.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>For convenience in walking she had turned up
her outer garment; now, at the entrance of the
village, she let it down and went on with quick
steps without once turning back.</p>

<p>Amrie kept her face bent down in order to see
the keepsake upon her neck, but the necklace was
too short. Dami was chewing the last piece of his
stick when his sister, observing tears in his eyes,
said, “We shall see—you will have the most
beautiful pair of trousers in the village.”</p>

<p>“I will not take them,” said Dami, and spit out
the last piece of stick.</p>

<p>“And I will ask her to give you a knife. I will
stay at home the whole day; perhaps she will come
to us.”</p>

<p>“Yes! if she were there already,” said Dami,
without knowing what he said. His anger, and the
feeling of being rejected, had excited these suspicious
reproaches.</p>

<p>At the first stroke of the bell they hastened back
to the village. Amrie gave over, with few words,
her new ornament into the hands of Mariann, who
said, “Thou art fortune’s child! I will take good
care of it. Now hasten to the church.”</p>

<p>During the service both children looked constantly
at their new friend, and when it was over
they waited for her at the door of the church; but
the respectable matron was so surrounded by men
and women, all claiming her notice, that she could
only turn in the circle to answer, sometimes here,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
sometimes there; thus for the waiting glances of
the children she found no attention. She held Rose,
the youngest daughter of Farmer Rodel, by the
hand. She was a year older than Amrie, and
thrust herself constantly before the latter, as though
pressingly to take her place by the matron. Had,
then, the respectable matron eyes only for Amrie
by the last house in the solitude of the village, but
in the midst of the people she did not know her?
Amrie was frightened, when this thought just
dawning in her mind was spoken aloud by Dami;
but while she, with her brother, followed at a distance
the great crowd that surrounded the matron,
she gave utterance herself to the same thought.
The matron vanished at last into the house of
Farmer Rodel, and the children turned quietly
back.</p>

<p>“When she comes,” said Dami, “tell her that
she must go to Krappenzacher and tell him that he
must treat me better.”</p>

<p>Amrie nodded, and the children separated, each
to go to the house where they had found shelter.</p>

<p>The fog that had been so great in the morning
now came down in pouring rain. The great red
umbrella of Madam Landfried moved here and there
in the village, and the form that was under it could
scarcely be seen. Mariann had not met her, and
at coming home she said, “She can come to me—I
shall not seek her again.”</p>

<p>The two children wandered out again, and sat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
down together upon the threshold of their parents’
house. They waited silently, and again the
thought came to them, that their parents would
never return to them. Dami would count how
many drops fell from the roof. But they came all
too quickly, and he shouted out at once, “A thousand
million.”</p>

<p>“She must pass here as she goes home,” said
Amrie, “and we will call to her. Only cry out
at the same time with me, and then she will speak
to us again.”</p>

<p>So said Amrie, for the children waited here only
for the Landfried to pass.</p>

<p>A whip snapped in the village; they heard the
quick step of a horse upon the road, and a carriage
rolled by. Their friend sat within it.</p>

<p>“Our father and mother will come in a carriage
to fetch us,” said Dami. Amrie cast a melancholy
glance at her brother. “Do not chatter
so,” she said. As she turned again, the wagon was
close to them, and some one nodded from beneath
the red umbrella. It rolled on, only Mathew’s
dog barked after it, and made as though he would
seize the spokes of the wheels with his teeth. At
the fish-pond he turned back, barked once more,
and then slipped into the house.</p>

<p>“Hurrah! she has gone,” cried Dami with triumph.
“That was the Landfried. Did not you
know Farmer Rodel’s black horse?”</p>

<p>“Don’t forget my leather trousers,” he shrieked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
with all the strength of his lungs, although the
wagon had already vanished in the valley, and was
creeping up the little height of the Holder Meadow.
The children turned back silently to the village.</p>

<p>Who can tell how this bitter experience struck
a tiny root into the inner being of a child, and
what may hereafter spring from it? Other feelings
may immediately overpower the consciousness
of this heavy disappointment, but the bitter root
has struck into the soul.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III.<br>

<small>THE TREE BY THE PARENTS’ HOUSE.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE day before “All Souls” Mariann said to
the children, “Go and find the mountain-ash
berries; to-morrow we shall want them for the
churchyard.”</p>

<p>“I know where I can find them,” said Dami,
with a truly avaricious joy, and ran out of the village
with such haste that Amrie could scarcely
overtake him. When she arrived at the parental
house, he was already upon the tree, and signed
proudly to her that she should also come up, because
he knew that she could not. He plucked
the red berries and threw them down into the
apron of his sister. She prayed him to break off
the stems with the berries, and she would weave a
crown. “That I shall not,” he answered, and yet
there came no berry down afterwards without a
stem.</p>

<p>“Listen, how the sparrows scold,” cried Dami
from the tree. “They are angry because I take
their food from them.” When he had plucked
them all, he said, “I will not go down again from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
this tree, but will stay up here day and night,
till I fall down dead. I will never go down to you,
Amrie, unless you promise me something.”</p>

<p>“What then?”</p>

<p>“That you will never wear the present that the
Landfried gave you—never, as long—as long as
I can see it.”</p>

<p>“No!”</p>

<p>“Then I will never come down.”</p>

<p>“Not on my account?” said Amrie, and went
and sat down at a little distance, behind a pile
of wood, and began to weave a crown, peeping
out, however, every moment, to see if Dami was
coming. She placed the crown upon her head,
but suddenly an inexpressible anxiety, on account
of Dami, overcame her. She ran back. Dami
sat upon a branch, his back against the trunk of
the tree, and his arms crossed before him.</p>

<p>“Come down,” she said, “Oh! come down; I
will promise every thing you wish.” In a second
Dami was at her side, upon the ground.</p>

<p>They went home, and Mariann scolded the foolish
children because they had made crowns from
the berries which were needed at the graves of
their parents. She tore the crowns apart—at the
same time saying some mysterious words. Then
she took both children by the hand, and led them
out to the churchyard. Pointing to the two
graves lying together, she said, “There are your
parents!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>The children looked amazed at each other.
Mariann made, with a stick, a deep cross upon both
the graves, and showed the children how to strew
the berries therein. Dami was the more nimble,
and triumphed because his red cross was ready before
his sister’s. Amrie looked at him with tears,
and when Dami said, “That will make father
glad,” she gave him a little blow and said, “Be
still!”</p>

<p>Dami wept, more perhaps because he had become
serious. Then Amrie cried aloud, “for Heaven’s
sake forgive me—oh! forgive me that I did that.
Yesterday I promised, that for my whole life long I
would do for you all I can, and give you all that I
have. Say, Dami, that I have not hurt you. Can
you not forget it? It shall never happen again as
long as I live. Oh never! never again! Never!
Oh, mother! Oh, father! I will be good! I promise
you, Oh, mother! Oh, father!” She could say no
more, but wept silently, and they say that one
deep sob after another convulsed her. Then as
Brown Mariann wept aloud, Amrie wept with her.</p>

<p>They went home, and as Dami said, “Good-night,”
she whispered softly in his ear, “Now I
know that we shall never see our parents again in
this world!” Yet in this communication there
mixed a certain childish joy, a child’s pride in
knowing something, a consciousness that the parents’
lips are closed forever. When death closes
the lips of one who must call thee child, a living<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
breath has vanished which can never again return.</p>

<p>As Mariann sat by the bed of Amrie, the child
said to her, “I feel as though I were falling and
falling forever! Let me have your hand.” She
held her hand fast and began to slumber, but as
often as Mariann withdrew her hand she caught it
again. Mariann understood what that feeling of
endless falling signified to the child. By the inward
consciousness of the death of her parents,
which she had gained to-day, they seemed to her
to hover in an undefined distance,—she knew not
whence, nor where. Not before midnight could
Mariann leave the bed of the child, and after she
had repeated her prayers, who knows how many
times?</p>

<p>A stern scorn lay upon the countenance of the
sleeping child. One hand was crossed upon her
breast. Mariann took it softly away, and said, as
though to herself, “If always an eye could watch
over thee, and a hand help thee, as now, in thy
sleep, and without thy knowledge could lift the
weight from thy heart! But this can no mortal
do—only He! Do thou to my child in a strange
country as I do for this.”</p>

<p>Brown Mariann was a person whom people feared—she
was so austere and crabbed in appearance.
It was eighteen years since she lost her
husband, who was shot as he made an attack with
other companions upon the post-wagon. Mariann<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
bore child beneath her heart, when her husband’s
corpse was brought into the village with his
blackened face. But she suppressed her agony,
and washed the black from the face of the dead, as
though she could thereby wash the guilt from
his soul. Her three daughters died in close succession,
after the last child was born. He had become
a smart little fellow, although with a strange
dark face. He was now a journeyman mason, out
upon his wanderings in some distant place; and his
mother, who for her whole life had never been out
of the village, and never had any desire to wander,
often said, “That she was like a hen who had
hatched one egg, but clucked always secretly at
home.”</p>

<p>It would scarcely be believed that Mariann was
one of the most cheerful persons in the village.
She was never observed to be melancholy. She
would not allow people to pity her, and therefore
she was disliked and solitary. In winter she was
the most industrious spinner in the village, and in
summer the most diligent wood-gatherer, so that
she was able to sell a good part of it.</p>

<p>“My John,”—so she called her son,—“My
John,” was heard in every sentence from her lips.
The little Amrie, she said, she had taken not out of
compassion, but because she would have a living
being near her. She was rough and cross outwardly,
and to other people, and enjoyed secretly
the pride of being kind, and doing right.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>Exactly the opposite of this was Krappenzacher,
with whom Dami had found a shelter. Before the
world he showed himself one of the most good-humored
benefactors; in secret he ill treated his
dependants and especially Dami, for whom he received
but a very small compensation. His true
name was Zacharia. He received his nickname
because he once brought home to his wife what he
called a daintily-prepared roast, of a pair of doves.
They were but a pair of plucked ravens, here in
the country named Krappen. Krappenzacher spent
the most of his time knitting woollen stockings
and jackets, and sat with his knitting-needles in
any part of the village where tattling was to be
had. This gossip in which he heard every thing,
served him to meddle with the business of his
neighbors. He was the so-called match-maker of
the place. When any of his marriages were really
brought about, he played the violin at the wedding.
In this he was really a country amateur. He also
played the clarionet and the horn, when his arm
was weary with the fiddle. He was, indeed, a
“Jack-of-all-trades.”</p>

<p>Thus were both scions, which had sprung from
the same root, transplanted into very different soil.
Position and culture, and the nature which they
severally possessed, would lead them to very different
fortunes.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV.<br>

<small>OPEN THE DOOR.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">ALL SOULS’ DAY, it was dark and foggy.
The children were among the people collected
in the churchyard. Krappenzacher had led
little Dami by the hand, but Amrie had come alone
without Brown Mariann. Many of the people
scolded at the hard-hearted woman, and some
touched upon the truth, when they said, “Mariann
could gain nothing by a visit to the churchyard, for
she knew not where her husband was buried.”</p>

<p>Amrie was quiet, and shed no tears; while
Dami, through the pitying speeches of the people,
wept freely, and especially because Krappenzacher
secretly scolded and cuffed him.</p>

<p>Amrie stood a long time dreamily forgetting herself,
looking fixedly at the lights at the head of the
graves, how the flame consumed the wax, the wick
burnt to coal, till at last the light was wholly
burnt down.</p>

<p>Among the people, there moved around a man in
a respectable city dress, with a ribbon in his button-hole.
It was Severin, the Inspector of Buildings—upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
a journey, who had come to visit the
graves of his father and mother. His sister and
her family surrounded him continually with a certain
reverence, and indeed the attention of every
one was directed towards this respectable visitor.</p>

<p>Amrie observed him, and asked Krappenzacher,
“If he were a bridegroom?”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Because he has a ribbon in his button-hole.”</p>

<p>Instead of answering the child, Krappenzacher
hastened towards a group to say what a stupid
speech the child had made. And around among
the graves echoed loud laughter at such silliness.</p>

<p>But the wife of Farmer Rodel said, “I find it
not so very foolish. If Severin wears it as an
honorable distinction, it is yet strange that he
should wear it in the churchyard; here where all
are equal, whether in life they have been dressed
in silk or fustian. It had already displeased me
that he wore it in the church. We must lay aside
something before we go into the church; how
much more in the churchyard!”</p>

<p>The question of little Amrie must at length have
reached the ear of Severin, for he was seen hastily
to button his overcoat, and nod towards the child.
He asked who she was, and scarcely had he heard
the answer, than he hastened towards the children
at the fresh graves, and said to Amrie, “Come,
child, open thy hand. Here, I give thee a ducat;
buy thyself whatever you want.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>The child stared at him, and did not answer.
But when Severin had turned away, she said half
aloud, “I take no presents,” and threw the ducat
after him. Many of the people who saw this came
up to Amrie and scolded her, and were on the
point of ill treating her, had not Madame Rodel,
who had already protected her with words, now
saved her from their rough hands. She, also,
desired that Amrie should at least hasten after
Severin and thank him; but Amrie was silent, and
remained obstinate, so that her protectress left her.
After much search, the ducat was found. The
Mayor took it immediately into his possession, to
give it over to the guardian of the child.</p>

<p>These incidents brought the little Amrie a
strange reputation in the village. They said she
had been only a few days with Brown Mariann, and
had already acquired her manners and her character.
It was unheard of, they repeated, that a
child of such poverty should have so much pride;
and while they reproached her whole bearing on
account of this pride, it was the more apparent that
this principle of independence in the young
childish soul was there to protect her. Brown
Mariann did all she could to strengthen this disposition.
She said, “No greater good fortune can
happen to the poor than that they should be called
proud. It is the only safeguard; for every one
would trample upon them, and then expect that
they should thank them for doing it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>In the winter, Amrie was often at the fireside
with Krappenzacher, listening eagerly to his violin.
Yes, Krappenzacher once gave her great praise.
He said, “Child, you are not stupid;” for after
listening a long time Amrie had said, “It is wonderful
how a fiddle can hold its breath so long. I
cannot do it.” And at home in the quiet winter
nights when Brown Mariann related exciting or
horrible tales, or magical histories, Amrie, drawing
a long breath when they were ended, would say,
“Oh, Mariann, I must now take breath, for as long
as you are speaking I cannot breathe; I must hold
my breath.”</p>

<p>Was not that a sign of deep devotion to what
was present, and yet a remarkable free observation
of the same, and of her own relation to it?</p>

<p>No one took much notice of Amrie, and she was
left to dream of whatever came into her mind.
The school-teacher once said, in the sitting of the
Parish Council, “That he had never met with such
a child; that she was proud, but gentle and submissive;
dreamy, and yet wide-awake; and in fact
she had already, with all her childish self-forgetfulness,
a feeling of self-reliance; a certain self-defence
in opposition to the world, its favor and its
wickedness.” Dami, on the contrary, at every
little occasion, came weeping and complaining to
his sister. He always had great pity for himself;
and when, in the rough play of his companions, he
was thrown down, he would say, “Yes, because I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
am an orphan, they hurt me. Oh, if only my
father or my mother knew it!”</p>

<p>Dami would take presents of food from anybody
who offered them, and was therefore always eating,
while Amrie was satisfied with very little, and
accustomed herself to be very moderate in every
thing. Even the rudest and wildest boy feared
Amrie without knowing why; while Dami ran from
the youngest. In the school, Dami was always uneasy,
moving his hands and his feet, and the corners
of his book were dog’s-eared. Amrie, on the contrary,
was always neat, active, and diligent. She
wept often in the school, not because she was punished,
for that was very rare, but because Dami
often received correction.</p>

<p>Amrie could please her brother best when she
told him riddles. Both children sat often near
the house of their rich guardian; sometimes by the
wagon, sometimes by the oven at the back of the
house, where they warmed themselves, especially
in the autumn. And Amrie asked, “What is the
best thing about the oven?”</p>

<p>“You know that I can’t guess,” said Dami, complainingly.</p>

<p>“Then I will tell you. The best of the oven is,
that it does not eat the bread that is put into its
mouth;” and, pointing to the wagon before the
house, she said, “What is nothing but holes, and
yet holds fast?” Without waiting for the answer,
she said, “That is a chain.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>“Now you have given me two riddles?” said
Dami. And Amrie answered, “Yes, but you give
them up. See, there come the sheep; now, I know
another.”</p>

<p>“No,” cried Dami. “No! I can’t hold three; I
have enough with two.”</p>

<p>“No, you must hear this, else I take the others
back;” and Dami repeated anxiously to himself,
“chain,” “self-eating,” while Amrie asked, “Upon
which side have the sheep the most wool?”</p>

<p>“Baa, baa! upon the outside,” she added, gayly
singing, while Dami sprang away to tell the riddles
to his comrades. When he reached them, he had
forgotten all but the chain, and Rodel’s eldest
boy, whom he did not ask, immediately cried out
the solution. Then Dami came weeping back to
his sister.</p>

<p>The little Amrie’s knowledge of riddles could
not long remain concealed from the village; and
even the rich, serious farmers, who scarcely spoke
with any one, especially not with a poor child, often
stopped from their work, and asked the little Amrie
to give them a riddle. That she knew a great
number which she might have heard from Mariann,
was easy to believe, but that she could always
answer new ones, excited universal wonder. She
could not cross the street or the field without being
stopped. She made it a rule that she would give
no man the solution of her riddles, and they were
ashamed at once to give them up. She knew how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
to turn from them, so that they were banished, as
it were. Yet never in a village was a poor child
so much respected as the little Amrie. But as she
grew to womanhood, she excited less attention; for
men observe the blossom and the fruit with a sympathizing
eye, but not the long ripening process
from one stage to the other. Before Amrie left
school, destiny gave her a riddle to guess whose
solution was very difficult.</p>

<p>The children had an uncle who lived about seven
hours’ journey from Holdenbrunn, a wood-hewer in
Fluorn. They had seen him once, at the funeral of
their parents; he walked behind the Mayor, who
led the children by the hand. Since then the
children had often dreamed of their uncle in Fluorn.
They were often told that he looked like their
father, and since they had given up the hope that
father and mother would come back again, they
were more curious to see their uncle. But as years
passed, and they every year strewed the mountain-ash
berries on their graves, and they had learned to
read the names of their parents upon the same dark
cross, they forgot the uncle in Fluorn. In all these
years they had heard nothing of him. Both children
were called one day into the house of their
guardian. There sat a man large and tall, with a
brown complexion.</p>

<p>“Come here, children,” cried the man, at their
entrance. He had a rough, harsh voice. “Do you
not know me?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>The children looked at him with open eyes. Did
there awake in them the recollection of their
father’s voice? The man continued, “I am your
father’s brother. Come here, Lisbeth! And you,
also, Dami.”</p>

<p>“I am not Lisbeth; my name is Amrie,” said the
young girl, and wept. She gave her uncle no hand;
a feeling of estrangement made her tremble, because
her uncle had called her by a false name.
How could there be any true dependence on him,
when he had forgotten her name?</p>

<p>“If you are my uncle, why did you not know my
name?” she asked many times.</p>

<p>“Thou art a stupid child; go immediately and
give him thy hand,” ordered Farmer Rodel; then
he added half aloud to the stranger, “She is a
strange child; Brown Mariann has put wonderful
things into her head, and you know that all is not
right with her.”</p>

<p>Amrie looked deeply wounded, and tremblingly
gave the uncle her hand. Dami had already done
it, and now asked, “Uncle, have you brought us
any thing?”</p>

<p>“I had not much to bring. I bring myself—and
you will go home with me. Do you know,
Amrie, it is not right that you will not know your
uncle. You have no one else in the whole world.
Whom have you beside? Come, think better of it;
sit near me—still nearer; do you see that Dami
is much more sensible? He looks more like our
family—but you belong to us also.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>A maid came and brought in some garments.
“These are thy brother’s clothes,” said Rodel to
the stranger; and turning to Amrie he said,—“Do
you see, these are thy father’s clothes; we
will take them, and you also, will go first to
Fluorn, and then over the brook.”</p>

<p>Amrie touched, tenderly and tremblingly, first
the coat of her father, and then his blue striped
waistcoat. The uncle held the clothes up, and
pointing to the worn elbows, said to Farmer
Rodel,—“They are not worth much; I don’t
know whether I could wear them over there in
America without being laughed at.”</p>

<p>Amrie seized convulsively the sleeve of the coat.
That they should say the dress of her father was
of little value; that, which she had thought of
inestimable worth; and that this dress should be
worn in America, and there laughed at, confused
and confounded all her ideas, especially those
about America.</p>

<p>It was soon made clear to her, for Madame
Rodel came in, and with her Brown Mariann.
Madame said,—</p>

<p>“Listen, for once, husband; this I think must
not go on so quickly. The children must not be
sent in such haste with this man to America.”</p>

<p>“He is their only living relation, the brother of
Josenhans.”</p>

<p>“Yes indeed, but he has not till now shown
that he is a relation, and I think they cannot do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
this without leave of the Parish Council. The
children have in the Parish a right of home, and
they cannot take it away in their sleep; the children
cannot say themselves what they will do, and
that I call taking them in their sleep.”</p>

<p>“My Amrie is wide-awake enough. She is just
thirteen, but as wise as another of thirty years,”
said Mariann.</p>

<p>“You both should be counsellors,” said Rodel.</p>

<p>“But I also am of opinion that children should
not be taken away like calves with a halter.
Good! Let the man speak with them alone;
afterwards, let them decide what they will do.
He is their natural guardian, and has the right
to take the father’s place. Listen; go with thy
brother’s children a little out of the village while
the women remain here—there speak to them
alone.”</p>

<p>The wood-hewer took both children by the hand
and left the house with them.</p>

<p>“Where shall we go?” he asked the children
in the street.</p>

<p>“If thou wouldst be our father, go home with
us. There is our house,” said Dami.</p>

<p>“Is it open?”</p>

<p>“No! but Mathew has the key. He has never
let us go in. I will spring before and fetch the
key;” and Dami withdrew his hand and sprang
before. Amrie followed, as though fettered to the
hand of the uncle, who now spoke with more confidence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
and interest. He told her as an excuse
that he had an expensive family; that he and his
wife with difficulty supported five children. But
now, he informed her, a man who possessed large
forests in America had offered him a free passage,
and after the forest was felled, a good number of
acres from the best land as a free possession. In
gratitude to God, who had thus provided for him
and his children, he had immediately thought it
would be a good deed to take his brother’s children
with him. He would not constrain them,
and would take them only with the condition
that they could look upon him as their second
father.</p>

<p>Amrie, after these words, looked earnestly at
him. If she only could make out to love this man!
But she feared him, and knew not what to do.
That he had fallen, as it were, out of the clouds so
suddenly, and desired her love, only excited her
opposition to him.</p>

<p>“Where then is thy wife?” asked Amrie. She
might well feel that a woman had been milder and
more suitable for this business.</p>

<p>“I will tell thee, honestly,” answered the uncle,
“that my wife will have nothing to do in this
affair. She says, ‘she will say nothing for nor
against it.’ She is a little harsh, but only at first;
and if you are amiable towards her, you are so
sensible that you can wind her round your finger.
If any thing should occur that you do not like,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
think that you are with your father’s brother, and
tell me alone, and I will do all I can to help you.
But you will see that now you begin first to
live.”</p>

<p>Amrie stood with tears in her eyes, and yet she
could say nothing. She felt this man was wholly
strange to her. His voice, like her father’s, moved
her; but when she looked at him, she would willingly
have fled from him.</p>

<p>Dami came with the key. Amrie would have
taken it from him, but he would not give it up.
With the peculiar pedantic conscientiousness of a
child, he said he had sacredly promised Mathew’s
wife that he would give the key only to his uncle.
He received it, and to Amrie it appeared as though
a magical secret was to open when the key, for the
first time, rattled and then turned in the lock.
The bolt bent back and the door opened. A
peculiar tomb-like coldness breathed from the dark
room that had formerly served as a kitchen. Upon
the hearth lay the cold heaped ashes, and upon the
door were written the first letters of “Caspar
Melchior Balthes.” Underneath, the date of the
death of the parents written with chalk. Amrie
read it aloud. “Father wrote it,” said Dami.
“Look, the 8’s are made just as you make them;
such as the teacher will not suffer. Look, from
right to left.” Amrie winked at him to be
quiet. To her it was fearful and sinful that
Dami should talk so lightly here where it seemed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
to her like a church; yes, as though they were in
eternity; quite out of the world, and yet in it.
She opened the door. The little room was dark
and gloomy; for the shutters were closed, and
only a trembling sunbeam pressed through a crack,
and fell upon an angel’s head upon the door of
the stove, so that the angel appeared to laugh.
Amrie, frightened, could scarcely stand, but when
she looked again, her uncle had opened one of the
windows, and the warm air from without pressed
into the room. There was no furniture in the
apartment, except a bench nailed to the wall.
There had the mother spun, and there had she
pressed the little hands of Amrie together, and
taught her to knit.</p>

<p>“So, children, now we will go,” said the uncle.
“There is nothing good here. Come with me to
the baker’s. I will buy for both a white loaf; or
would you rather have a cracknel?”</p>

<p>“No, no, stay a little longer,” said Amrie, always
stroking the place where her mother had sat.
Then pointing to a white spot on the wall she said
in a low voice, “There hung our cuckoo clock, and
the soldier’s reward of our father; and there is
the place where the skeins of yarn hung, that our
mother spun. She could spin finer than Brown
Mariann. Yes, Mariann said so herself; always
quicker, and more out of a pound of wool than any
other; and all so even, there was not a single knot
in it; and see there is the ring there upon the wall.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
That was beautiful when she had finished a skein.
If I, at that time, had been old enough, I would
never have consented that they should sell my
mother’s distaff; it was my inheritance. But there
was nobody to care for us. Oh, dear mother! oh,
dear father! if you only knew how we are thrust
about, it would make you sorry even in your blessedness!”</p>

<p>Amrie began to weep aloud, and Dami wept with
her. Even the uncle dried a tear, and pressed
them to go now. It seemed to him that this unnecessary
heart-rending did neither himself nor the
children any good. But Amrie said decidedly,
“If you go now, I will not go with you.”</p>

<p>“How do you mean that? You will not go with
me?”</p>

<p>Amrie was frightened. She now thought of
what she had said. And indeed it might be taken
as consenting; but she immediately answered,—</p>

<p>“No, of other things I know nothing now. I
only meant that I would not go out of this house
till I had seen every thing again. Come, Dami,
thou art my brother. Come with me to the garret;
you know where we used to play hide, behind
the chimney. And then we will look out of the
window where we dried the mushrooms. Don’t
you remember the beautiful gold piece father received
for them?”</p>

<p>Something shook and rolled over the ceiling.
All three were frightened. But the uncle quickly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
said, “Stay here, Dami; and you also, Amrie.
Why would you go up there? Do you not hear
how the mice rattle?”</p>

<p>“Come with me,” urged Amrie; “they will not
eat us.” But Dami declared he would not go, and
though Amrie was secretly afraid, she took heart
and went up alone to the garret. She soon came
back as pale as death, and had nothing in her hand
but a basket of straw.</p>

<p>“Dami will go with me to America,” said the
uncle, as she entered again. She was breaking up
the straw in her hand. “I have nothing against
it. I do not know what I shall do; but he can go
alone,” she said.</p>

<p>“No!” cried Dami, “that I will not. Thou
didst not go with Madame Landfried, when she
would have thee; and so I will not go alone; but
with thee!”</p>

<p>“Now, then, think of it; you are sensible enough
to do so,” concluded the uncle, bolting again the
window-shutters, so that they stood in the darkness.
He pressed the children to the door, and
then out of the house; locked the house door, and
went to Mathew’s with the key, and then with
Dami alone, into the village. He called out from a
distance to Amrie, “You can have till the morning,
early, to decide. Then I shall go, whether you go
with me or not.”</p>

<p>Amrie was alone. She looked after him as he
went on, and it seemed strange to her that one man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
could go away from another, if that other belonged
to him. There he goes, she thought, yet he belongs
to thee, and thou to him.</p>

<p>Strange! as it sometimes happens in dreams that
come we know not how. So it now seemed to
Amrie in her waking dream. Wholly accidentally,
had Dami spoken of her meeting with Madame
Landfried.</p>

<p>The meeting had almost faded out of her recollection,
and now it awoke clear and distinct as a
picture from out of her past dreamed life. Amrie
said, indeed, aloud to herself, “Who knows whether
she also does not suddenly, she cannot say why,
think of me; and perhaps now, just at this
minute, for there in that spot, she promised that she
would be my protector whenever I went to her.
There by the willow-trees she promised. Why do
the trees remain standing so that we may always
see them, and why not also a word, like a tree, that
stands firm so that we can hold by it, and why not
by a word? Yes, it comes only from this, that
they WILL; a word would be as good as a tree,
and what an honorable woman said must be as firm
and as true. She also wept, because she had left
her home. But it was long before, that she was
married from this village, and now has children.
One is called John.”</p>

<p>Amrie stood by the mountain-ash tree, and laid
her hand upon its stem and said,—</p>

<p>“Thou! why then dost thou not go forth? Why<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
do not men call upon thee to wander away? Perhaps
it would be better for thee in another place?
But thou didst not place thyself here. Who
knows whether thou didst not come from another
place. Stupid stuff! Yes, if he were my father I
must go with him. He would not ask me. He
who asks much, goes often wrong. Nobody can
advise me—not even Mariann, and with our uncle
it will be thus. If he does thee good, thou
must pay him again. If he should be severe to
me, and against Dami (because Dami is not sensible),
after we have gone with him—where should
we turn in that wild strange world? Here every
man knows us. Every hedge, every tree, has a
well-known face. Ah, ha! thou knowest me,” she
said again looking up at the tree. “Oh, if thou
couldst only speak! Thou wert created by God!
Oh, why canst thou not speak? Thou hast known
my father and my mother so well—why canst
thou not tell me what they would advise? Oh,
dear father! Oh, dear mother! to me it is so sad
that I should go away—yet I have nothing here,
and no one to care for me, and yet it would be as
though I must get out of a warm bed, into the
cold snow. Is that, which makes me so sorry to
go, a sign that I should not go? Is it a right conscience,
or is it only a foolish anxiety? Oh, dear
Heaven! I know not. Oh, if only a voice from
Heaven would come and tell me.”</p>

<p>The child trembled like a leaf, from the deepest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
anxiety; and from this conflict of life, which
now made its voice heard within her. Again
she half spoke, half thought—but now more
resolved.</p>

<p>“If I were alone I know certainly that I would
not go. I would remain here. It is too hard to
go; and I could, if alone, take care of myself. Ah,
let me remember that! With myself I am perfectly
agreed. I am one! Yes, but what a
foolish thought. How can I think I am one—alone—without
Dami! I am not alone. Dami
belongs to me and I to him. For Dami were it
better,—better for him if he were under a father
who would tell him, and teach him what is right.
But canst thou not care for him thyself, when it is
necessary? I see plainly that if he were once at
home there, he would remain there his life long,
and be nothing but a servant, a dog for strange
people to kick. Who knows how the children of
the uncle would treat us? As they are poor
people themselves, would they not play the master
towards us? No, no, they are certainly good, and
it would be beautiful if they would say, ‘Good-morning
cousin,’ or ‘good-day, aunt.’ If our
uncle had only brought one of the children with
him, then I could have understood it all much better,
and spoken much easier. Oh, dear! How is
it all at once so difficult?”</p>

<p>Amrie sat down at the foot of the tree. A
chaffinch came tripping about, picked up a little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
seed here and there, looked around, and then flew
away. She felt something creeping over her face.
She swept it off with her hand. It was a little
winged beetle. She suffered it to creep around
upon her hand, between the mountains and valleys
of her fingers, till it came upon the point of her finger,
and flew away. “Perhaps he would tell thee
where he has been,” thought Amrie. “Ah, it is
well with such a little animal, wherever he flies,
he is at home. And, listen! how the larks sing.
It is well with them also; they need not think
what they must say, and what they have to do.
There drives the butcher, with his dog, a calf, out
of the village. The butcher’s dog has a very different
voice from the lark, but, indeed, they could
not drive a calf with the song of the lark.”</p>

<p>“Where are you going with the foal?” cried
Mathew, out of his window, to a young fellow who
had a beautiful foal by a halter. “Farmer Rodel
has sold it,” sounded the answer, and soon they
heard the foal neigh in the valley beneath.</p>

<p>Amrie, as she heard this, must again think.
“Yes, an animal is sold away from its mother, and
the mother scarcely knows it, or who has taken it
away. But they cannot sell a man; for him there
is no halter. There comes Farmer Rodel with his
horses, and the great foal springs after his mother.
A man is not sold; he belongs to himself alone.
An animal receives for his work no other reward
than eating and drinking, and needs, indeed, nothing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
else; but a man gains money as a reward for
his work. Ah, yes! I can be a servant, and from
my wages I can have Dami taught, and he can be
a mason. But if we were with our uncle, Dami
would be no longer mine as he is now. Listen!
the starlings are flying home—there, above, in the
house father set up for them, and they sing gayly.
Father made the house out of old boards. I know
now what he said, ‘that a starling would not fly
into a house made of new boards.’ So it is with
me!—Thou, tree, now I know! If thou shouldst
rustle while I am sitting here by thee, I will
remain here.”</p>

<p>Amrie listened breathless. Soon it seemed as
though the tree rustled. She looked up at the
branches, but they were motionless. She could
not tell what she heard. A noisy cackling was
heard on all sides; it came nearer, preceded by a
cloud of dust. It was the flocks of geese driven
home from the Holden Meadows. While the noise
lasted, Amrie looked after them.</p>

<p>Her eyes closed. She was slumbering. A
whole spring of flowers opened within this soul,
with the blossoming trees in the valley that absorbed
the cooling night dew, sending their perfume
over to the child, who was sleeping upon
the hearth of the home she could not leave.</p>

<p>It had long been night when she awoke as a
voice cried, “Amrie, where art thou?” She rose
up, but did not answer. She looked round astonished,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
and then at the stars, and it seemed to her
that the voice came from Heaven. As it was repeated,
she knew it was the voice of Mariann, and
answered, “Here I am.” Now came Brown
Mariann nearer and said, “Oh, it is well that I
have found thee. The whole village is, as it were,
gone mad! One said, ‘I have seen her in the
woods;’ another, ‘I met her in the field;’ and to
me it seemed as though thou hadst thrown thyself
into the fish-pond. Thou needst not fear, dear
child! thou needst not fly! No one can force thee
to go with thy uncle!”</p>

<p>“Who has said that I will not go?” Suddenly
a quick wind breathed through the tree, so that
the branches rustled powerfully. “But certainly
I will not,” said Amrie, and laid her hand upon the
tree.</p>

<p>“Come home! a severe shower is rising, and we
shall have a high wind immediately; come home,”
urged Brown Mariann.</p>

<p>Giddily Amrie went with Mariann into the
village. The night was pitch dark, and only by
the sudden flashes of lightning could they see the
houses which shone as in clear daylight, so that
their eyes were blinded, and they stood still in
the darkness when the lightning vanished. In
their own village home they seemed bewildered
as in a strange place, and stepped uncertain, and
confusedly forwards. Bathed in perspiration they
toiled forwards, and came at last under heavy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
drops of rain to their own door-stone. A gust of
wind tore open the door, as Amrie cried, “Open!”
She might have thought of a fairy tale where,
at an enigmatical word, an enchanted castle
opened.</p>

<small>UPON THE HOLDER COMMON.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE next morning when her uncle came, Amrie
declared that she should remain at home.
There was a strange mixture of bitterness and benevolence
when her uncle said, “Indeed, thou
tak’st after thy mother, who would never have any
thing to do with us. But I cannot take Dami
alone, even if he would go. For a long time he
would do nothing but eat bread. Thou couldst
have earned it.”</p>

<p>Amrie urged, “that for the present they would
remain here in their village, and later, if her uncle
remained of the same mind, she, with her brother,
could go to him.”</p>

<p>The resolution of Amrie was somewhat shaken
by the manner in which her uncle expressed his
sympathy for the children, but she did not venture
to say so, and only answered, “Greet your children
and say to them, that it is very hard for me
never to have seen my nearest relations, and as
they are going over the sea, I shall probably never
see them in my whole life.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>Their uncle only said, “Greet Dami from me; I
have no time to bid him farewell,” and he was
gone.</p>

<p>As soon as Dami came in, and learned that he
was gone, he would have run after him, as indeed
Amrie was almost inclined to do, but she constrained
herself again to remain. She spoke and
acted as though some one had ordered every word
and every motion, and yet her thoughts flew on the
way that her uncle had taken. She went with
her brother, hand in hand, through the village, and
nodded to every one she met. She had now
returned to them all. She was on the point of
being torn away, and she thought they must all be
as glad as herself that she did not go. But, alas!
she soon remarked that they not only would have
willingly parted with her, but they were angry
that she did not go. Krappenzacher opened his
eyes and said, “Yes, child, you have a proud spirit,
and the whole village is angry with you for thrusting
your fortune away with your foot. Every one
says, ‘Who knows but it might have been a
fortune for thee,’ and then they calculate how
soon you will come upon the Parish. Do something,
therefore, that you may not come upon the
public alms.”</p>

<p>“Yes, ah! what shall I do?”</p>

<p>“Madame Rodel would have willingly taken
you into service, but her husband would not consent.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>Amrie felt, that from henceforth she must be
doubly brave, that she might meet no reproach
from herself or from others, and she asked again,
“Do you then know of nothing that I can do?”</p>

<p>“Indeed you must be afraid of nothing but of
begging. Have you not heard that the foolish
little Fridolin yesterday killed two of the Sacristan’s
geese? The goose-herd’s service is now
open, and I advise you to take it.”<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<p>This soon happened, and by noon of that day
Amrie was driving the geese upon the Holder
Green, as they called the pasture-ground upon the
little height by Hungerbrook. Dami helped his
sister faithfully in this work.</p>

<p>Brown Mariann was very much dissatisfied with
this new servitude, and asserted, not without some
truth, “that the odium followed a person their life
long, who once held such an office. People never
forget it. If you attempt any thing else they say,
‘Ah, that is the goose-herd;’ and if, even out of
pity, they should take you, you will receive a poor
reward, and bad treatment. They will say, ‘Ah,
it is good enough for a goose-herd.’”</p>

<p>“That will not be so very bad,” answered Amrie;
“and you have related many hundred histories
where goose-herds have become queens.”</p>

<p>“That was in the olden time. But who knows,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
thou art of the old world; many times it appears
to me that thou art not a child. Who knows then,
thou ancient soul! perhaps some miracle will happen
to thee!”</p>

<p>This opinion, that she was not on the lowest
step of the ladder of honor, but that there was
something upon which she could step down, made
Amrie suddenly pause. For herself she could
gain nothing more at present, but she would no
longer suffer Dami to herd the geese with her. He
was a man, and he should be one. It might injure
him if it could afterwards be said that he had
formerly kept the geese. But with all her zeal
she could not make it clear to him. He was
angry with her. It is always so. At the point
where the understanding ceases, there begins an
inward obstinacy; inward imbecility passes into
outward injustice, and sometimes into injurious
action.</p>

<p>Amrie rejoiced, that Dami could be for so many
days angry with her; she hoped he would learn
to stand up against others and assert his own
will.</p>

<p>Dami also received an office. He was apprenticed
by his guardian as Scarecrow. He turned
the rattle the whole day in the quiet garden of
Rodel’s farm to scare the sparrows from the early
cherries, and from the salad-beds. But this,
which in the beginning was only play, he soon
gave up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>It was a pleasant, but also a troublesome office,
that Amrie had undertaken. It was especially
often painful that she could do nothing to attach
the animals to her. Indeed, they were scarcely to
be distinguished, one from another; and was it not
true what Brown Mariann had once said to her as
she came out of the Moosbrunnenwood?</p>

<p>“Animals that live in herds, are all, each for
himself, stupid.”</p>

<p>“I think,” added Amrie, “that geese on this
account are stupid; that they can do too much.
They can swim, and run, and fly, but they are
neither in the water, nor on the ground, nor in
the air, expert, or at home, and that makes them
stupid.”</p>

<p>“I will stand by this,” said Mariann, “in thee is
concealed an old hermit.”</p>

<p>In fact there formed itself in Amrie a disposition
to solitary dreaminess, which was rarely
interrupted by the occurrences of life. But, as
through all the dreaming and observation of
nature she continued industriously to knit, and
to let no stitch drop; and as on the corner by the
service-tree, the deepening night shadows and
the refreshing strawberries were so near each
other, that they appeared to sprout from the same
root:—thus were the distinct representations of
nature and the dreamy twilight of life near each
other in the heart of the child.</p>

<p>Holder Green was no solitary, secluded place,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
filled with fairy tales that the curious world only
would willingly seek. In the midst, through the
Holder Pasture, led a field-path, to Endringen, and
not far from it stood the different colored boundary
pillars, with the armorial bearings of the two gentlemen
proprietors whose lands joined each other.
Peasants passed through with every species of
agricultural implements; men, women and girls
went by with hatchets, sickles and scythes. The
bailiffs of both estates often came through, and the
reflection of their rifles glittered long before and
long after they passed. Amrie was always greeted
by the several bailiffs when she sat by the way,
and was often asked whether this one or that one
had passed by, but she never betrayed any one.
Perhaps this concealment was from that inward
dislike that the people, and especially the village
children, have for the bailiff, who is always represented
as the armed enemy of the peasantry, going
about to seek whom he can insnare.</p>

<p>Old Manz, who was employed to break stones on
the road, never spoke a word to Amrie. He went
sadly from one heap of stones to another, and the
sound of his pick was incessant as the tapping of
the woodpecker, or the shrill chirp of the grasshoppers
in the meadows and clover-field.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding all these human influences,
Amrie was often borne into the kingdom of
dreams. Freely soared her childish soul upwards
and cradled itself in unlimited ether. As the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
larks in the air sang and rejoiced without knowing
the limits of their field, so would she soar away
beyond the boundaries of the whole country.
The soul of the child knew nothing of the limits
placed upon the narrow life of reality. Whoever
is accustomed to wonder, will find a miracle in
every day.</p>

<p>“Listen,” she would say; “the cuckoo calls!
This is the living echo of the woods which calls
and answers itself. The bird sits over there in the
service-tree. If you look up, he will fly away.
How loud he calls, and how unceasingly! That
little bird has a stronger voice than a man! Place
thyself upon the tree and imitate him,—thou wilt
not be heard as far as this bird, who is no larger
than my hand. Listen! Perhaps he is an enchanted
prince, and suddenly he may begin to
speak to thee. Yes,” she said, “only tell me thy
riddle, and let me think a little, and I will soon find
the meaning of it; and then I will disenchant thee,
and we will go into thy golden castle and take
Mariann and Dami with us, and Dami shall marry
the princess, thy sister, and we will then seek
Mariann’s John through the whole world, and
whoever finds him shall conquer thy kingdom.
Ah! were it then all true? And why could I
think it all out if it were not true?”</p>

<p>While the thoughts of Amrie thus soared beyond
all limits, the geese also felt themselves at liberty
to stray and enjoy the good things of the neighboring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
clover or barley field. Awaking out of her
dreams, she had heavy trouble to bring the geese
back; and, when these freebooters came in regiments,
they had much to tell of the promised land
where they had fed so well. To their gossiping
and chattering there seemed no end. Here and
there was heard an old goose holding on, after all
the others had ceased, with a drowsy or significant
word, while others stuck their bills beneath their
wings, and continued to dream of the goodly land.</p>

<p>Again Amrie soared, “Look! there fly the birds.
No bird in the air goes astray; even the swallows,
in their continually crossing flight, are always safe,
always free! Oh! could we only fly! How must
the world look above where the larks soar. Hurrah!
always higher and higher, farther and farther!
Oh, could I fly! I would fly into the wide
world and to the Landfried, and see what she does,
and ask her whether she ever thinks of me.</p>

<p class="center">‘Thinkest thou of me in distant lands?’”</p>

<p>Thus she sang herself suddenly away from all
the noise and from all her thoughts. Her breath,
which by the thought of flight had become deeper
and quicker, as though she really hovered in the
higher ether, became again calm and measured.</p>

<p>But not always glowed her cheek in waking
dreams; not always did the sun shine clear in
the open flowers and in the bending grain. In the
spring came those cold, wet days, in which the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
blossoming trees stood like trembling foreigners,
and all day long the sun scarcely beamed upon
them. A sterile frost pierced through the natural
world, interrupted only by gusts of wind that tore
and scattered the blossoms from the trees. The
larks alone kept jubilee, high in the air, above the
clouds; and the finches’ little complaining note
was heard from the wild pear-tree, against which
Amrie leant. Now, in white stripes, rattled down
the hail, and the geese pointed their beaks upwards,
that the tender brain might not be hurt.
There above, behind Endringen, it is already clear,
and the sun will soon break through the clouds
and the hills; the woods and the fields will look
like the human countenance, which has been
bathed in the tears of grief, but now shines out
with beams of joy. The geese, which through
the shower had pressed close together, and turned
their bills upward, now venture to spread themselves
apart and graze, and gaggle of the passing
storm to the young, tender, downy brood, who have
never before lived through such an experience.</p>

<p>Immediately after Amrie had been overtaken by
the hail-storm, she endeavored to provide for the
future. She took with her, out upon the green
pasture, an empty corn-sack, which she had inherited
from her father. Two axes, crossed with
the name of her father, were painted upon it.
When the showers came down, she covered and
folded herself within it, and looked out from a protecting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
roof upon the wild conflict in the sky. A
cold shower of snow would end in melancholy,
which would sometimes overpower her. Then she
would weep over the destiny which left her so
alone—deprived of father and mother—thrust
out, as it were, from her fellows. But she early
gained a power that trial and difficulty teaches
one to exert, to swallow down her tears. This
makes the eyes sparkle, and to be doubly clear in
the midst of all trouble.</p>

<p>Amrie could conquer her melancholy, especially
when she recollected a proverb of Brown Mariann’s.
“Who will not have his hands frozen in
the cold, must double his fist.” Amrie did so, both
spiritually and physically. She looked proudly
into the world, and soon cheerfulness came over
her face. She rejoiced at the beautiful lightning,
and held her breath till the thunder followed after.
The geese pressed close together, and looked
strangely at the lightning.</p>

<p>“They,” said Amrie, “experience only good.
All the clothing they need grows upon their bodies;
and for that which is pulled out in the spring,
other is already provided. When the shower is
over, there is joy in the air and in the trees, and
the geese rejoice in the rare luxuries it has left,
pressing upon each other, greedily consume the
snails and the young frogs that venture forth after
it is over.”</p>

<p>Of the thousand-fold meanings that lived in Amrie’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
soul, Brown Mariann received only, at times,
the intimation. Once, when she came from the
forest with her load of wood, and imprisoned in
her sack May-bugs and worms for Amrie’s geese,
the latter said to her,—</p>

<p>“Aunt, do you know why the wind blows?”</p>

<p>“No! do you know?”</p>

<p>“Yes; I have remarked every thing that grows
must move about. The bird flies, the beetle
creeps; the hare, the stag, the horse, and all animals,
must run. The fish swim, and frogs also.
But there stand the trees, the corn, and the grass;
they cannot go forth, and yet they must grow.
Then comes the wind and says, ‘Only remain
standing, and I will do for you what others can do
for themselves. See, how I turn, and shake, and
bend you. Be glad that I come; I do thee good,
even if I make thee weary.’”</p>

<p>Brown Mariann said nothing, except her usual
speech:</p>

<p>“I maintain it; in thee is concealed the soul
of an old hermit.”</p>

<p>Once only Mariann led the quiet observation of
Amrie upon another trace.</p>

<p>The quail began already to be heard in the high
rye-fields; near Amrie, the field-larks sang the
whole day incessantly. They wandered here and
there, and sang so tenderly, so into the deepest
heart, it seemed as though they drew their inspiration
from the source of life—from the soul itself.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
The tone was more beautiful than that of the skylark,
which soars high in the air. Often one of
the birds came so near to Amrie, that she said,
“Why cannot I tell thee that I will not hurt
thee? Only stay!” But the bird was timid,
and removed farther off. Then Amrie considered
quickly, and said, “It is well that the birds are
timid, else we could not drive away the thievish
starlings.”</p>

<p>At noon, when Mariann came to her, she said,
“Could I only know what a bird, all through the
live-long day, has to say; and, even then, he has
not sung it all out.”</p>

<p>Mariann answered, “Look, an animal can keep
nothing back to reflect upon and resolve it in himself.
But in man something is always speaking;
it does not cease, although it is never loud. There
are thoughts that sing, weep, and speak, but
quietly; we scarcely hear them ourselves. Not
so the bird—when he ceases singing, he is ready
to eat or sleep.”</p>

<p>As Mariann turned and went forth with her
bundle of wood, Amrie looked smiling after her.
“There goes a great singing bird,” she thought.
None but the sun saw how long the child continued
to smile and to think.</p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>Thus, day after day, Amrie lived. Long she sat
dreaming, as the wind moved the shadows of the
branches around her. Then she gazed at the
motionless banks of clouds on the horizon, or upon
the flying clouds that chased each other through
the sky. As without, in the wide space, so in the
soul of the child the cloud-pictures arose and
melted away, receiving, for the moment only, existence
and form. Who can tell how the soul of the
child interpreted and gave life to the cloud, within
or without?</p>

<p>When spring breaks over the earth, thou canst
not comprehend the thousand-fold seeds and
sprouts spread over the ground—the singing
and jubilee upon the branches and in the air. A
single lark seizes upon eye and ear. It soars aloft.
For a time thou canst follow it as it spreads its
wings; for a time thou canst not determine
whether that dark point is thy vanishing lark.
Now it is gone from thy eye, and soon from thy
ear; for thou canst not tell if the singing thou
hearest comes from thy vanished lark. Couldst
thou listen for a whole day to a single lark in the
whole wide heaven, thou wouldst hear that the
morning, the mid-day, and the evening song, are
wholly different; and couldst thou trace it from its
first trembling pipe, through the whole year, thou
wouldst find what various tones mingle in its
spring, its summer, and its harvest song. Over
the first stubble-field sing a new brood of larks.</p>

<p>When the spring breaks in a human soul,—when
the whole world opens before it and within
it,—thou canst not understand the thousand
voices that make themselves heard. Thou canst<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
not seize nor hold the thousand buds and blossoms
that perpetually unfold and extend themselves;
thou only knowest that there it sings, and that it
expands.</p>

<p>How quietly spring appeared again in the firmly
rooted plant. There, by the meadow-hedge and
the pear-tree, the sloe blossomed early, and was
only rarely ripe. What a beautiful bloom has the
whortleberry, and what a powerful perfume it has!
The little pears are quite formed, and glow with a
faint red; and the poisonous night-shade already
looks dark. Soon will come those clear, sharp-cut,
harvest days, when the atmosphere is of so clear
and cloudless a blue, that during the whole day the
half-moon can be seen in the sky; then we mark
how it fills itself, and how it wanes, till only a
finely-cut side, like a little cloud, stands in the
horizon. In nature, and in the human soul, there
is a pause before the goal is reached.</p>

<p>There was soon life upon the road that led
through the Holder Green. Quickly rattling went
the empty peasants’ wagons, where sat women and
children, and laughed,—shaken by laughing as
well as by the rolling of the wagons. Then they
came, sheaf-laden, slowly back, creaking homewards.
Reapers, both men and women, passed
very near Amrie.</p>

<p>She gained of the rich harvest only what her
geese, who boldly followed the laden wagons,
robbed from their hanging sheaves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>There often comes into men’s souls, with all their
joy over the harvested fields and the harvest blessing,
a certain timidity. Expectation has become
certainty; and where all was so moving and transitory,
it is now quiet. The season has changed.
Summer has turned to frost.</p>

<p>The brooks upon Holder Green, in whose flood
the geese contentedly struggled, had the best water
in the place. The passer-by often paused at the
broad channel to drink, while their animals ran
before. Then, rinsing their mouths, they ran,
shrieking after them. Others, returning from the
fields, watered their beasts here.</p>

<p>Amrie gained the favor of many through a little
earthern cup which she had begged from Mariann.
Often, when the passers came to the brook, Amrie
offered her cup, saying, “You can drink better
with this.” Upon the return of the cup rested
many friendly glances, sometimes a longer, sometimes
a shorter time upon her. This did her so
much good, that she was almost vexed if any one
went over without drinking. She would stand by
the brook with her cup full, running over; and, if
these signs failed, she surprised her geese with an
unlooked for bath. One day there came a Berner
chaise with two stately white horses. A broad,
Oberland farmer completely filled the double seat.
He drew up and asked, “Girl! hast thou nothing
to drink with?”</p>

<p>“Indeed I have—all ready.” Trembling, Amrie
brought her cup full of water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>“Ah,” said the Oberlander, after he had taken a
good draught, and with dripping mouth half in the
cup, half out, “in the whole world there is no such
water as that.”</p>

<p>He began again, and winked to Amrie that she
should be quiet, for he had but just begun; and it
was particularly disagreeable to speak while one
was drinking. The child seemed to understand
this; and, after he had given back the cup, she
said, “Yes, the water is good and healthy. If
your horses would drink, it is for them, especially,
good.”</p>

<p>“My horses are warm, and need not drink at
present. Are you of Holderbrunnen, maiden?”</p>

<p>“Truly.”</p>

<p>“And what is your name?”</p>

<p>“Amrie.”</p>

<p>“To whom dost thou belong?”</p>

<p>“To no one now. Josenhans was my father.”</p>

<p>“What! The Josenhans that worked with
Farmer Rodel?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I knew him well. It was hard that he must
die so early. Wait, child, I will give you something.”
He drew a great leather purse from his
pocket, and felt a long time within it, and said at
last,</p>

<p>“See, take that.”</p>

<p>“I do not take any presents, I thank you. I
take nothing.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>“Take it. Of me you can certainly take something.
Is not Farmer Rodel your guardian?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Well?”</p>

<p>“He should have known better than to make
you a goose-herd. God bless thee!”</p>

<p>The carriage rolled on, and Amrie held the
money in her hand. “‘Of me you can certainly
take something!’ Who, then, is the man who
said that, and why did he not make himself known?
Eh! This is a groschen. There is the bird
upon it. Well, it will not make him poor, nor me
rich.”</p>

<p>The whole day long, Amrie did not offer her cup
to a single passenger. She felt a secret timidity
lest she should have another present.</p>

<p>When she came home in the evening, Mariann
told her that Farmer Rodel had sent to say she
was to go to him immediately. She hastened to
his house. Rodel said, as she entered,</p>

<p>“What did you say to the Esquire Landfried?”</p>

<p>“I know no Squire Landfried.”</p>

<p>“He has been to-day on the Holder Green, and
has made thee a present.”</p>

<p>“I did not know who it was, and there is his
money.”</p>

<p>“That is nothing to me! Tell me instantly,
honestly, and truly, did I persuade you to be
goose-herd? If you do not give it up this very
day, I am no longer your guardian. I will not be
slandered!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>“I shall inform everybody that it is not your
fault,” said Amrie; “but to give the service up,
that I cannot. Till the summer is over I must
remain in it. I must finish what I have engaged
to do.”</p>

<p>The farmer’s wife, who lay sick in bed, cried out
to her, “Thou art right. Remain only so, and I
prophesy that you will do well. A hundred years
hence they will say of one who is fortunate in this
village, ‘This is like Brosis’ Severin and the
Josenhans.’ Amrie, take courage! thy dry bread
will yet fall into a honey cup!”</p>

<p>The sick woman was thought crack-brained;
and, from fear of madness, Amrie, without answering,
hastened away.</p>

<p>She soon imparted to Mariann that a wonderful
thing had happened to her. The Esquire Landfried,
of whose wife she thought so often, had
spoken with her, had said something of her to
Rodel, and had made her a present. She showed
her the money.</p>

<p>Mariann cried, laughing, “Ah, that I could
have guessed. That is like the Landfried! That
is noble! to give the poor child a false groschen!”</p>

<p>“Why, is it then false?” asked Amrie, and the
tears sprang into her eyes.</p>

<p>“That is a worn-out birds’ groschen, worth only
half a kreutzer.”</p>

<p>“He would have given me the other half,” said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
Amrie, gravely. And now for the first time she
showed an inward opposition towards Mariann.
The latter rejoiced at every thing wicked that she
heard of people. Amrie, on the contrary, ascribed
every thing to good motives. She was always
happy. She forgot all realities in the happy
dreams of her solitude. She expected nothing
from others. She was therefore surprised if she
received any thing, and was always thankful for the
slightest favor.</p>

<p>“He has given me only half a kreutzer; that
is enough, and I am satisfied.” She repeated this
proudly to herself, while she ate her solitary supper,
as though she were yet speaking to Mariann,
who was not in the house, but meantime milked
her goat.</p>

<p>In the night, she stitched the coin between two
pieces of cloth, and hung it as an amulet around
her neck, and concealed it on her breast. It
seemed as though the impression of the bird upon
the money waked the bird in the heart upon
which it rested. Full of inward joy, she sang and
hummed her songs all day from morning till evening;
and thus she thought always again of Farmer
Landfried’s lady. She had now seen both, and had
of both a memento, and it seemed to her as though
they left her only for a short time there; and that
the Berner chaise, with the two white horses,
would come again,—the farmer’s people sitting
within,—and bring her away. And they would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
say, “Thou art our child;” for certainly the Landfried
would relate at home how he had met her.</p>

<p>With penetrating glances she looked into the
autumn sky,—it was so clear, so cloudless,—and
then upon the earth, where the meadows were yet
green; and the hemp, lying in rows, spread out to
dry, appeared like a fine net upon the ground, the
autumn flowers looking up between,—the ravens
flying above, their black wing feathers glistening
in the bright sunshine. No wind blew; all was
calm. The cows ruminated upon the stubble-fields;
cracking of whips and songs echoed from
all the meadows; and the pear-tree shivered its
branches together, and shook down its leaves;
autumn was there.</p>

<p>When at evening Amrie went home, she looked
askingly in Mariann’s face; she thought it must
tell her that the Landfried had sent to fetch her.
With a heavy heart, she drove her geese to the
stubble-field that was so far away from the road
that led to the Holder Green, where she longed
to return. But the hedges were already leafless.
The larks, in their heavy downward flight, scarcely
twittered a single note,—and yet there came no
message; and Amrie felt as timid, in prospect of
the winter, as she would have been before a prison.
She consoled herself a little with the reward she
received, which was especially rich. Not one of
her fledglings had fallen—not one was lamed.
Mariann not only sold the feathers that Amrie had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
collected, at a good price, but advised her not to
follow the old custom,—which, at the time her
salary was paid, for every goose that had been
herded, to give a piece of church-consecrated cake.
Mariann advised her to exchange the cake for good,
sound bread. Thus they had bread the winter
through, of very old baking indeed; but, as Mariann
said, “Amrie’s teeth were as sound and
white as those of a mouse, and could nip through
every thing.”</p>

<p>Throughout the village, nothing was now heard
but the thresher’s flail, and Amrie said, “The
whole summer long, the corn in the ear heard
only the song of the lark; now, men bruise its
head with the flail, and how different is the
sound!”</p>

<p>“An old hermit’s soul is concealed within thee,”
was the final sentence of Brown Mariann.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">A WOMAN who led a solitary, reserved life,—who
cooked and ate her food alone,—was
called her own cook,—Eigenbrätlerin,—and to
such an one was given all sorts of peculiarities.
No one ever had more right, or more inclination,
to be her own cook, than Brown Mariann, although
she never had any thing to cook, except oat porridge
and potatoes. Potatoes and oat porridge
were her only food. She lived always retired
within herself, and conversed willingly with no
one. Towards harvest only was she full of excited
restlessness. At this time she was heard
talking with herself, and also speaking to all the
men, especially strangers, who went through the
village. She inquired of them whether the masons
from here and there had returned home to their
winter rest, and whether they had said any thing
of her John. When the linen which she had been
bleaching through the summer was finally ready
to wash, she remained up the whole night, and was
heard to murmur to herself. Nothing was understood,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
except when she divided the webs she was
heard to say, “That is for thee, and this is for me.”
She said, daily, twelve pater-nosters for John; but,
on washing-night, they were innumerable. When
the first snow fell, she was wonderfully cheerful.
“Now, when there is no more work; now, he will
certainly come home.”</p>

<p>At this time she told her old white hen, which
she kept in a coop, that she must die, for John was
coming home.</p>

<p>Thus she had been for many years. The villagers
represented to her that it was foolish always
to be thinking of John’s return. But she did not
change, and was only every year more ungracious
to the people.</p>

<p>It was eighteen years, this autumn, since John
left her. Every year there was a notice written
in the newspaper to “John Michael Winkler” to
return, even should it be in his fiftieth year. He
was now six and thirty.</p>

<p>The report went about the village, that John
had joined the gypsies, and his mother kept a
young gypsy with her, who looked strikingly like
the lost John; he had the same dark face, and was
not unwilling to be regarded as her son. The
mother placed a proof before him. She had yet in
her possession the hymn-book and the confirmation
certificate of her son. She tried them in this manner:
one who did not know who had been his god-father,
or remember the day when Brosis’ Severin,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
with the English woman, arrived; and later, when
the new town-house fountain was opened, and other
remarkable things, must be false. Yet Mariann
sheltered the young gypsy, whenever he came to
the village; and the children in the street shrieked
after him, “John! John!”</p>

<p>Every year the schoolmaster sent a letter to Mariann,
written to John, which she laid in the hymn-book,
not knowing where to send it. It was well
that she knew not how to read, for this year he
sent her the letter of another, instead of the one
desired. For now a strange report was murmured
through the whole village. Where two met
together they spoke of it, and whispered, “Say
nothing to Mariann. It would kill her! it would
make her insane!”</p>

<p>It was, namely, information that the Ambassador
in Paris had received and imparted through all the
higher and lower officers, till the news reached
the village, “That John Winkler, of Holdenbrunn,
had fallen, fighting at one of the outposts in
Algiers.”</p>

<p>It was talked of in the village, and every one
said how strange that so many high officers should
trouble themselves about the dead John; and concluded
that so certain a stream of information must
be true. In the sitting of the council, it was
resolved to say nothing to Brown Mariann. It
was unjust to imbitter the few years she had to
live, by taking from her her last consolation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>But, instead of keeping the information secret,
the Mayor hastened to tattle it out at home, and
the whole village, all but Mariann, were soon in
possession of the news. Every one observed her
with strange glances—they were afraid they
should betray themselves—they scarcely returned
her greetings.</p>

<p>It would have been better if Amrie also had
known nothing; but there lay a peculiarly seducing
charm in coming as near as possible to the
forbidden subject, and of course everybody spoke
with Amrie of the melancholy occurrence, warned
her to say nothing of it to Mariann, and asked
“whether the mother had had no warning, no
dream? Were there no strange voices in the
house?”</p>

<p>Amrie was full of secret trembling and fear.
She alone was near Mariann, and knew something
that she must conceal from her. The people, also,
of whom she hired a small apartment, kept themselves
out of her neighborhood, and signified their
compassion by giving her warning to quit.</p>

<p>How strangely in life things are connected
together. Through this occurrence Amrie experienced
both joy and sorrow; for the parental house
was again opened to them. Mariann moved into
it. Amrie, although in the beginning full of fear,
accustomed herself to go in and out; and, when
she had kindled the fire, and drawn the water, she
believed her father and mother must come again.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
At last she felt herself wholly at home. She spun
day and night, till she earned enough to re-purchase
from Mathew the cuckoo clock which had
belonged to her parents. She was now too happy
to possess a piece of her old domestic furniture.
But the cuckoo had suffered among strangers,
had lost half of his voice, and the other half
remained buried in his throat. He could only say
“cuck,” and as often as he did that, Amrie at first
added, unconsciously, the other “coo,” but she
complained of that half-tone, and especially that it
was not so beautiful as in her early childhood.
Then said Mariann,—</p>

<p>“Who knows, that if in later years we should
receive again what has made us perfectly happy in
childhood, I believe that, like the cuckoo clock, it
would have but half its sound. If I could only
teach thee, child, what cost me so much till I had
learnt it—never to wish for what happened yesterday.
That, can no one give. We may try to
purchase it, through sweat and tears shaken together!
It can be found in no apothecary’s shop.
Cling to nothing, Amrie—to no man—to no cause—then
canst thou fly alone!”</p>

<p>These speeches of Mariann were at the same
time wild and timid. They came out only in the
twilight, like wild animals from the forest. It was
only with difficulty that Amrie accustomed herself
to her misanthropy.</p>

<p>Mariann could not endure the half-word repeating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
of the clock, and hung the pendulum wholly
outside so that the clock merely ticked, and no
longer gave out the hour. At length the ticking
alone disturbed her, so that at last the poor clock
was no longer wound up. She said she had always
a clock in her head. It was wonderful, that although
time was very indifferent to her, she always
knew the hour to an exact minute. There was a
singular wakefulness in her, watching and listening
as she always was for news of her son, and
although she visited no one, and spoke to no one,
yet she knew every thing that took place in the
village,—even the most secret things that occurred.
She guessed every thing from the manner
in which people met her, and from scattered
words; and, as this appeared miraculous, she was
feared and avoided. From one end of the year to
the other, she ate daily some juniper-berries. It
was said that was the reason she was so active,
and that she would never see her sixty-sixth year,
for no one would believe that even now both sixes
belonged to her age. They said she milked her
black goats, hours long, that gave her indeed much
milk, and she willingly milked these only. She
detested milk drawn from the udder of cows. It
was called witchcraft that she succeeded always in
rearing fowls, for where could she find food for
them, and how could she always have eggs and
chickens to sell? They saw her, indeed, in summer,
collect May-bugs, grasshoppers, and all kinds<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
of worms; and in moonless nights she was observed
darting like a will-o’-the-wisp among the
graves with a resin torch, collecting the rain-worms,
and talking in a low voice with herself.
Yes, it was said, that in the quiet winter nights,
alone by herself, she held wonderful conversations
with her goat and her hens.</p>

<p>Amrie often trembled, in the long quiet winter
nights, when she sat solitary, spinning by Mariann,
and heard nothing but the half-sleeping cluck of
the fowls, and the convulsive starts of the goat;
for it appeared like witchcraft that Mariann spun
so quickly. “Yes,” she once said, “I think my
John helps me spin”—and yet she complained
that this winter, for the first time, she could not
always be thinking of her John. She reproached
herself on this account, and said, she was a bad
mother, for it seemed to her that the features of
her son vanished by degrees, and as though she
forgot what he had done here and there; how
he smiled; how he sang and wept; how he had
climbed the trees, and sprung over the hedges.</p>

<p>“It would be frightful,” she said, “if one could
thus by degrees vanish from the mind, so that we
could remember nothing rightly about them.” To
Amrie it was dreadful thus perpetually to hear of
one that was dead as though he yet lived. Again,
Mariann complained, “It is sinful that I can no
longer weep for my John. I once heard that we
could weep for one that was lost as long as he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
lived, or till he is buried. When he is beneath
the ground, all weeping ceases.”</p>

<p>“No, that cannot be! That dare not be! My
John cannot be dead! Thou darest not do that
to me, Thou, there above! But no! Forgive me,
good God, that I so strive against the wall! But
open thou the door; open it and let my John come
in! Oh, the joy!—Come, sit thou there, John!
Tell me nothing! I will hear nothing! I will
only know that thou art there. It is good! It is
enough! The long, long years have now become
a minute. What has happened to me? Where
hast thou wandered? Where thou hast been I
have not been—but now thou art here, and thou
shalt never again leave this hand till it is cold.
Oh, Amrie, my John must wait till thou art grown.
I say no more. Why dost thou not speak?”</p>

<p>Amrie felt as though deprived of breath, her
throat was dry. It seemed to her as though the
dead stood there—a spectre. The secret was
upon her lips. She might betray it, and the roof
fall in and all be buried.</p>

<p>Sometimes Mariann was talkative in another
manner, although all related to the one subject,
the remembrance of her son. Heavily came upon
Amrie the dark questions of the order of Providence.</p>

<p>“Why does a child die for which the mother
has waited, trembling—with her whole soul has
waited? I and my Dami, why are we lost children?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
We might so gladly seize the hand of our
mother, and that hand has become dust.”</p>

<p>These were dark and misty questions into which
the thoughts of the poor solitary child were driven.
She knew no other way to help herself out of the
labyrinth of doubt, than to softly repeat the Multiplication
Table.</p>

<p>On Saturday evening Mariann was willing to
talk. From an ancient superstition she would not
spin on Saturday evening. She always knit, and
if she had any thing to relate, she wound off at
first a good deal of her yarn, so as not to be
interrupted, and then she went on with the thread
of her story.</p>

<p>“Oh, child,” she always concluded, “remember
this, in thee is concealed the soul of an old hermit;
whoever would live a good, exact life, that person
must live alone. Willingly receive of no one.
Knowest thou who is rich? He who needs nothing
but that which he has! And who is poor?
He who wants to receive something from friends.
There sits one and waits for the hands that belong
to another’s body, and waits for the eyes that are
in another person’s head. Remain alone by thyself;
then thou hast thy own hands; thou needest
no other, and canst help thyself. Hope for any
thing to come to thee from another, and thou art a
beggar. Only to expect any thing from fortune,
from a fellow-creature, yes, even from God himself,
and thou art a beggar. Thou standest with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
outstretched hands for something to fall therein.
Remain alone! that is best—then thou hast all
in thyself. Alone! Oh, how good it is to be alone!
Look, in the depths of the ant-hill lies a little tiny
sparkling stone; whoever finds it can make himself
invisible, and no one can know his appearance.
But he who seeks it, must creep beneath others.
There is also a secret in this world. But who can
understand it? Find it. Take it to thyself. It
gives thee neither fortune nor misfortune. If a
man knows himself and other men aright, he can
make himself any thing he pleases, but only on
one condition,—he must remain alone! Alone,—alone!
Otherwise, nothing will help him!”</p>

<p>Thus she gave Amrie dark and half-expressed
meanings, which the child could not understand,—but
who knows how much remains forever engraved
in an attentive open soul, through words
half understood? Then, often looking wildly
around, she would say, “Oh, could I only be alone.
But one piece of me is under the ground, and
another is wandering around in the world, who
knows where? Oh that I were that black goat!”</p>

<p>However gently she began, the conclusion of her
remarks led always to regret and melancholy; and
she who would be always alone, and think of
and love no one, lived only by thinking of her son,
and loving him passionately.</p>

<p>At length Amrie thought of an effectual means
to save Mariann from this unhealthy desire to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
alone. She proposed that Dami also should be
taken into the house; but Brown Mariann opposed
this so violently, that Amrie threatened herself to
leave her alone. She also coaxed her so lovingly,
and presented the advantages so clearly, that at
length Mariann yielded, and gave in.</p>

<p>Dami, who had learnt wool-picking from Krappenzacher,
sat now in the evening in the parents’
apartment, and at night when he and his sister
slept in the store-room, they called to each other
when they heard Mariann flitting from room to
room, or talking in her sleep. Through the removal
of Dami there came fresh vexation. He
was altogether dissatisfied that he must pursue this
miserable work, which was only fit, he said, for
cripples. He wished to be a mason, and although
Amrie opposed this desire, for she feared her
brother would never persevere, Mariann encouraged
him in the wish. She would have
had all the young fellows become masons, so as
to send them into foreign countries to inquire for
her John.</p>

<p>She rarely went to church, but she loved to
have her hymn-book borrowed when others were
going. It was to her a peculiar satisfaction to
have her hymn-book in church, especially when a
stranger apprentice who was working in the village
borrowed it for that purpose. It seemed to
her that her John was praying in his own church,
because the words were spoken and sung out of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
his own hymn-book, and Dami had to go twice
to church every Sunday, to carry John’s hymn-book.</p>

<p>But although Mariann did not go to church,
there was one solemnity at which she never failed
to be present, whether in her own village or in the
neighborhood. No funeral took place at which
she was not present as a mourner; and even at the
grave of a young child, she wept as violently as
though she had been its mother, and yet on the
way home she would be especially cheerful. This
weeping appeared to be a real refreshment to her,
for during the whole year she suffered so much
silent sorrow, that she seemed thankful when tears
came to her relief.</p>

<p>Were her neighbors then to be blamed for looking
upon her as something unnatural, especially as
they possessed a secret regarding her, upon which
their lips were closed? Upon Amrie also fell a
part of this avoidance, and in many houses where
she offered help or sympathy, they suffered her to
remark that they did not desire her presence.
She did indeed display peculiarities, that appeared
wonderful to all the village. She went barefoot
through all except the very coldest winter. They
thought she must possess some secret charm
against sickness and death.</p>

<p>In Farmer Rodel’s house alone, was she willingly
received, as he was her guardian. Dame Rodel,
who had always taken her part, had promised that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
when she was grown up, she would take her into
her service. This plan could not be carried out,
because death first took her friend away. While
many are so happy, as to feel in later life only the
bitterness of existence, when one friend after another
leaves us, and their memory only remains,
Amrie learnt this in her early youth, and she wept
more passionately at the funeral of the farmer’s
wife, than any of her children or relatives.</p>

<p>The farmer, indeed, complained that he must
now give up the estate, and yet, neither of his
three children were married. But a year had
scarcely passed (it was the second that Dami had
worked in the stone quarry), when a double wedding
took place in the village. Farmer Rodel
celebrated the marriage of his eldest daughter,
and of his only son. On the same day, he gave
over the estate to his son. This double marriage
was the cause of a new name, and another life to
Amrie.</p>

<p>Upon the green enclosure, before the large dancing-hall,
the children were collected, and while
their elders danced and waltzed within, they imitated
their example. Strange, no boy or girl
would ask Amrie to dance. It was not known who
first said it, but they heard a voice exclaim: “Nobody
will dance with you, because you are barefoot.”
“Barefoot! barefoot! barefoot!” they now
shrieked from all sides. Amrie stood there; the
tears rushed to her eyes, but quickly exerting that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
power by which she overcame both scorn and
injury, she forced back her tears, and catching up
her apron at both sides she danced by herself so
gracefully and charmingly, that all the children
stood still and held back. Soon the grown people
nodded to each other around the door, and a circle
of men and women formed themselves about
Amrie, applauding her; especially Farmer Rodel,
who, feeling at this time doubly excited, clapped
his hands, and whistled the waltz, while the music
within played louder and louder, and Amrie contrived
to dance, and appeared to be insensible to
weariness. At length, the music ceased, the farmer
taking her by the hand said,—</p>

<p>“Thou flash of lightning, who then taught thee
to dance?”</p>

<p>“No one.”</p>

<p>“Why do you dance with no one?”</p>

<p>“It is better to dance alone. You need wait
for no one, and your partner is always with
you.”</p>

<p>“Have you had nothing yet from the marriage-supper?”
he asked simpering.</p>

<p>“No!”</p>

<p>“Come in and eat,” said the proud farmer, and
he placed her at the wedding-table, which continued
the whole day to be served afresh. Amrie
ate very little; but the farmer would have continued
his amusement by making her drink wine.</p>

<p>“No,” she said; “if I drink, somebody must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
lead me home; I could no longer go alone. Mariann
says, ‘One’s own feet is the best carriage—it
is always harnessed.’”</p>

<p>They were all astonished at the wit of the
child.</p>

<p>The young farmer came with his wife and asked
her, jokingly, “if she had brought them a wedding-present?
All who eat,” he said, “must bring a
present.”</p>

<p>At this question the old farmer, with incredible
generosity, secretly thrust a sixpence into
the child’s hand. Amrie, nodding to the farmer,
held the sixpence fast, and said to the young
couple,—</p>

<p>“I have now the promise and the fee. Your
departed mother promised that I, and no other,
should be nursery-maid to her first grandchild.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that was always her wish,” said the old
man. And now, that which, from fear of the orphan
becoming a charge to them, he had denied
his wife, during her life, he consented to now, when
it could no longer be a pleasure to her; while he
also gave himself the appearance of doing it out
of regard to her memory. He did not consent
from generosity, but from the well-founded expectation
that the orphan would be serviceable to himself,
while the charge of her remuneration would
fall upon another.</p>

<p>The young people looked at each other, and the
young farmer said,—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>“Bring thy bundle to-morrow morning to our
house; you can stay with us.”</p>

<p>“Good,” said Amrie; “to-morrow I will bring
my bundle, but now may I not take a bundle
away? Give me that flask of wine, and I will wrap
up this fowl with it, and take it to Mariann and my
Dami.”</p>

<p>They consented. Then the old farmer whispered
to her, “Give me back my sixpence. I
meant you should give it to them.”</p>

<p>“I take it from you as enlisting money,” said
Amrie, slyly, “and you will soon see that I will
quit scores with you.”</p>

<p>The old farmer smiled, although half angrily,
and Amrie went gayly away with money, wine, and
food, to poor Mariann and Dami.</p>

<p>The house was shut up, and presented to Amrie
the greatest possible contrast between the music,
noise, and feasting of the wedding-apartment, and
the deserted stillness of her home. Upon her
way home she knew where she could expect to
find Mariann. She went, indeed, almost every
evening to the stone quarry, and sat alone behind
the hedge, quietly listening to the sound of the
hammer and chisel. It was to her a melody out
of long past time, when John had once worked
here, and she had sat and listened to the sound
of his pickaxe.</p>

<p>Amrie met Mariann just returning; and half an
hour before the close of work she called Dami,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
and there, on the rocks, by the quarry, was held a
wedding-feast merrier than that within the house
at the sound of the fiddles.</p>

<p>Dami, especially, shouted loudly. Mariann was
also cheerful, but she took no wine. “Not a drop
of wine,” she said, “should pass her lips till she
drank it at the wedding of her John.”</p>

<p>As Amrie, under the influence of this cheerfulness,
related that she had taken service with the
young Farmer Rodel, and would enter upon it in
the morning, Mariann rose in the wildest anger,
and, picking up a stone, she pressed it upon her
breast, and cried,—</p>

<p>“It were a thousand times better that I had
this stone within my breast than a living heart!
Why cannot I always be alone! alone! Why
have I suffered myself to be persuaded to admit
another to my heart? But now it is past, and
forever. As I cast this stone away from me, so
will I cast away, henceforth, all dependence upon
any human being. Thou false, faithless child!
Scarcely canst thou stretch thy wings, and thou
art gone. But it is better so. I am alone, and
my John shall be alone. When he comes he
shall remain alone. What I would have had
has come to nothing.” And she ran forth to the
village.</p>

<p>“She is a witch,” said Dami. “I will drink no
more wine. Who knows whether she has not bewitched
it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>“Drink it, nevertheless,” said Amrie. “She
is a strange woman, and has a heavy cross to
bear. But I know how to comfort her.” Thus
she consoled Dami.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII.<br>

<small>THE SISTER OF CHARITY.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">FARMER RODEL’S house was once more full
of life. “Barefoot,” for so they continued
to call Amrie, was helpful everywhere, and soon
made herself beloved by all in the family. She
could tell the young wife, who was a stranger in
the village, what had been the customs of the
house, and taught her to conform to the peculiarities
of her nearest relatives. She knew how to
render little services to the old farmer, who grumbled
all day, and could not forgive himself, for having
so early given up the farm. She represented
to him, how much better his daughter-in-law really
was, than she knew how to show; and then, when
scarcely at the end of a year, the first child came,
Amrie showed so much joy, and so much cleverness,
in every emergency, that all in the house
were full of her praise; but, after the manner of
people, who are always more ready to find fault,
with the smallest mistake, than to give praise for
goodness.</p>

<p>But Amrie expected nothing, and she knew so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
well when to take the child to its grandfather, and
when to take it away again, that he should have
only pleasure therein. When she took it to show
him its first tooth, the old farmer said,—</p>

<p>“I would make you a present of a sixpence, for
the pleasure you have given me. But stay, the
one you stole from me on the wedding-day,—now,
you may honestly keep it.”</p>

<p>In the mean time, Mariann was not forgotten,
although it was very difficult to soften, and bring
her round again. She said she would have nothing
more to do with Barefoot, whose new master
would not allow her to continue the intercourse
with Mariann, especially to take the child there,
fearing, as they said, “that the witch might do him
an injury.” It needed great skill and patience, to
overcome this aversion. But at last, it succeeded.
Yes, little Barefoot knew how to bring it about, so
that at last, Farmer Rodel visited Mariann many
times. This was looked upon as a real miracle
by the whole village. The visits were soon again
stopped, for Mariann on one occasion said,—</p>

<p>“I am now near seventy years old, and have
done very well, without the friendship of any great
farmer. It is not worth while for me to change
now.”</p>

<p>Dami also wished, very naturally, to be often
with his sister; but this the young farmer would
not suffer, for he said, not without justice,—</p>

<p>“That he should have to feed this big, growing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
youth. In such a house, he could not prevent the
servants from sometimes giving him something to
eat.” He also forbade his coming on Sunday
afternoons to visit his sister. Dami had, in the
mean time, anticipated the comfort of being in so
well-stored a home, and his mouth watered to be
there, if only as a servant. The stone-mason’s was
a hungry life. Barefoot had much to overcome.
“He must remember,” she said, “that this was his
second craft, and that he must persevere; it was
a mistake to think he would gain any thing by
changing. If good fortune came, it would come
where he was, or not at all.” Dami was for a time
silenced, and so great was the influence of Amrie,
and so natural the care she took of her brother,
that he was always called, “Little Barefoot’s Dami,”
as though he were her son, rather than her brother,
although a whole head taller than his sister. Meantime,
he did not appear to be subject to her. Indeed,
he often fretted about it, that he was not
esteemed as much as his sister, because he had
not her tongue. This dissatisfaction with himself
and his position, was always poured out first upon
Amrie. She bore it patiently, and while he, outwardly
and ostentatiously, showed that she must
submit to him, she evidently gained still more respect
and consideration. Every one said, “how
good it was of Barefoot to do so much for her
brother, and to put up with his bad treatment,
while she worked for him as a mother would for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
her child.” In fact, she washed and sewed for him
during the night, so that he was always the neatest-dressed
boy in the village. The two pairs of
welted shoes that she received every half-year, as
a part of her wages, she exchanged with the shoemaker
for a pair for Dami, and went barefoot herself.
On Sunday, only, was she seen going to
church with shoes. Barefoot was much grieved
that Dami had become, they knew not how, the
common centre for all the jokes and ridicule of the
village. She blamed him severely, and told him
he should not suffer it. But, he answered, “she
might prevent it, he could not.” This was impossible,
and it did not seriously displease Dami to be
so treated. It wounded him, sometimes, when all
in the village laughed at him, and those younger
than himself took liberties with him, but it vexed
him much more not to be noticed by any one, and
this led him to make a fool of himself, and expose
himself to perpetual ridicule.</p>

<p>With Barefoot, on the contrary, the danger was
that she would become the Hermit that Mariann
had always predicted she would be. She had once
a solitary playmate and confidante, the daughter of
Mathew the coal-burner; but this girl had for some
years worked in a factory in Alsatia, and nothing
more was heard of her. Barefoot lived so much
within herself, that she was not reckoned among
the young people of the village. She was friendly
and talkative with those of her own age, but Brown<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
Mariann was her only confidante. Thus because
Amrie lived so apart from others, she had no influence
upon the relation which Dami held to others,
who, however much he was joked and laughed at,
must always cling to companions, and could never
bear to be alone like his sister.</p>

<p>At this time, Dami suddenly made himself quite
free, and one pleasant Sunday showed his sister the
earnest money he had received. He had hired
himself as farm-servant to Scheckennarr of Hirlingen.</p>

<p>“Had you told me,” said Barefoot, “I had found
a better service for you. I would have given you
a letter to Farmer Landfried’s wife, of Allgäu, and
they would have treated you like a son of the
house.”</p>

<p>“Oh! say nothing about that,” said Dami. “It
is now nearly thirteen years that she has owed me
a pair of leather breeches she promised me. Don’t
you recollect it,—when we were little, and thought
if we knocked, father and mother would open the
door? Do not speak of the farmer’s wife,—who
knows whether reminded with a word, she would
remember us? Who knows whether she is alive?”</p>

<p>“Yes, she lives yet. She is a relation of our
family, and is often mentioned there. She has
married all her children, except one son, who will
have the farm.”</p>

<p>“Now, you would disgust me with my new
service,” complained Dami, “and tell me I could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
have had a better. Is that right?” His voice
trembled.</p>

<p>“Oh! do not be so tender-hearted,” said Barefoot.
“What have I said against your good fortune?
You remind me of the time when the
geese bit you. I will only say, keep to that
which thou hast, and take care that you remain in
one place. It will not do to be like the cuckoo,
and sleep every night upon a different tree. I
could have another place. But I will not change.
I have succeeded in making this one comfortable.
Look,—he who is every minute changing, is
treated like a stranger. They do not make him a
home, because they know that to-morrow morning
he will be gone.”</p>

<p>“I do not need your sermons,” said Dami, turning
angrily away. “To me you are always harsh,
but to all the rest of the world gentle.”</p>

<p>“Because you are my brother,” said Amrie
laughing; and now she coaxed the obstinate boy.</p>

<p>There was, indeed, a strange difference between
the brother and sister. Dami was sometimes humble
as a beggar, and then suddenly proud, while
Barefoot, though always good-natured and obliging,
was sustained by an inward pride, that with all
her readiness to serve, she never laid aside.</p>

<p>She succeeded in pacifying her brother, and
said,—</p>

<p>“Look, something has just occurred to me; but
you must first promise to be good, for upon a bad<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
heart that coat must not lie. Farmer Rodel has
yet the clothes of our father. You are so large,
that they will just suit, and give you a respectable
appearance when you enter the farm-yard with the
other servants; they will see that you have had
honest parents.”</p>

<p>Dami was consoled, and in spite of many obstacles,
for old Rodel would not at first give up
the clothes, Barefoot brought him at length to
comply. Then she took Dami into her own chamber,
where he must immediately put on the coat
and waistcoat. He struggled against it, but what
she had once decided upon must be done! The
hat only, he would not have, but when the coat
was on, she laid her hand upon his shoulder and
said,—</p>

<p>“So, now thou art my brother and my father—and
now the coat goes, as at first, over the field;
but there is a new man within it. See, Dami!
Thou hast the noblest Sunday dress in the world.
Hold it in honor. Be therein as honest as was our
blessed father!”</p>

<p>She could say no more, but laying her head
upon the shoulder of her brother, her tears fell
upon the newly recovered dress of the father.</p>

<p>“You say that I am tender-hearted,” complained
Dami—“but you are far more so.”</p>

<p>In fact, Barefoot was quickly and deeply affected
by every thing; her heart was of the tenderest
emotion, but she was at the same time strong, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
light-hearted as a child. She was, as Mariann had
remarked at her first sleeping under the roof, of
the quickest sensibility. Waking and sleeping,
laughing and weeping, went hand in hand. Every
experience and every emotion was deeply felt, but
it was quickly over; and she was herself again.</p>

<p>She continued to weep.</p>

<p>“You give me a heavy heart,” whimpered Dami,
“and it was heavy enough before, that I must go
to find a home among strangers. You should have
cheered me—instead of so——so——”</p>

<p>“Honest thinking is the best cheering,” said
Barefoot—“that does not make one sad. But
you are right. You have enough to bear, and a
single pound laid upon a heavy load may break
one down. I have been stupid; but come, I will
see what the sun has to say, when the father
stands again before it. No, that was not what I
meant to say. Come—now you shall know where
we must go to take leave. If you were only going
a very short distance, you must still go to this
place to take leave. I am also sad enough, that I
shall have you no longer with me. No—I mean
that I shall be no longer with you. I would not
govern you as people say. Yes, yes! old Mariann
is right. Alone is a terrible word. We do not at
first learn its full meaning. So long as you were
there, across the street,—even if I was a whole
week without seeing you,—what did that matter?
I could see you at any moment, and that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
was as well as though we had been together,—but
now? Ah! well; you will not be out of the
world. But I pray thee take care of thyself. Do
not come to any harm. And if you tear your
clothes, send them to me; I will still sew and
mend for you. Now come,—now we will go to
the—to the churchyard!”</p>

<p>Dami opposed this, and again, with the excuse
that he was sad enough already, and that it would
only make him worse, Barefoot yielded this point
also. He took off his father’s clothes, and she
packed them in the sack that she had once worn
as a mantle when she took care of the geese, and
upon which remained the name of her father. She
charged Dami to send it back to her by the first
opportunity.</p>

<p>The brother and sister walked on together, till a
Hirlingen wagon came through the village. Dami
hailed it, and packed his bundle upon it. Then he
went hand in hand with his sister out of the village,
while Barefoot sought to cheer him.</p>

<p>“Do you remember the riddle I gave you about
the oven?”</p>

<p>“No!”</p>

<p>“Think,—what is the best thing about an
oven? Try to remember.”</p>

<p>“No!”</p>

<p>“The best thing about an oven is, that it does
not eat its own bread.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, you can be merry, you can stay at
home.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>“It is your own wish. You can also be merry
if you do right.” She went with her brother, till
she came to Holder Common. There, by the wild
pear-tree, she said,—</p>

<p>“Here we will take leave. God protect thee—and
fear no devil.”</p>

<p>They shook hands heartily. Then Dami went
on to Hirlingen, and Barefoot turned back to the
village. Not till she got to the foot of the hill,
where Dami could not see her, did she venture to
raise her apron to her eyes, to dry the tears that
rolled down her cheeks. Then she cried aloud,
“God forgive me for saying what I did, about
being alone. I thank thee, O God! that thou hast
given me a brother. Leave him only to me as
long as I live!”</p>

<p>As she came into the village, how empty it
seemed to her, and in the twilight when she rocked
the Rodel children to sleep, she could not bring a
single song to her lips, although she usually sang
like the lark. She could not help thinking, “Where
now is my brother; what are they saying to him;
how do they receive him;” and yet she could not
imagine how it was. She would have hastened
after him to tell them all how good he was, and
that they must be good to him. Then she consoled
herself with thinking that no one could entirely,
and at all times, protect another, and she hoped it
would be good for Dami to have to take care of
himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>It was already night. She went into her chamber,
bathed herself anew, braided her hair, and
dressed herself freshly, as though it were morning,
and with this extraordinary renewing of the day,
it seemed as though she began a fresh morning.</p>

<p>When all in the house were asleep, she went
over to Mariann, and sat long hours by her bed, in
the dark room. They talked to each other of the
feeling of having one away in the wide world, who
was yet a part of one’s self. Not till Mariann was
asleep did Barefoot slip away. But first she took
the pail, and brought water for the old woman,
and laid the wood in order upon the hearth, so that
in the morning she would only need to kindle the
fire. Then she went home.</p>

<p>What is that generosity which consists in spending
money? It is a power given into our hands
to be again diffused, and afterwards abdicated. It
is far otherwise with that original faculty which is
a part of ourselves. To part with this, is to give a
part of our life, and perhaps a part of all that remains
to us. The hours of rest, and the freedom
of Sunday, were all that Barefoot could call her
own, and these she sacrificed to Mariann. She
permitted herself to be blamed and scolded if any
thing crossed the old woman’s peculiarities, never
allowing herself to think or to say,—</p>

<p>“How can you scold me when I give you all I
possess?” Indeed she was not conscious that she
was making a sacrifice, only on Sunday evenings,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
when she sat in the solitude before the house, and
heard for the thousandth time, “What a brave
young fellow John had been on Sunday;” and
when the young men and girls of the village went
by singing all manner of songs, then would she
become aware that she was sacrificing her own
amusement, and she would sing softly to herself
the songs the others were singing in earnest. But
when she looked at Mariann she was silent, and
thought to herself that it was well Dami was not
in the village. He was no longer the butt of their
scorn, and when he returned he would certainly
be a young fellow whom all would respect.</p>

<p>On winter evenings, when, at Farmer Rodel’s,
there was spinning and singing, Barefoot would
venture to sing with them, and although she had a
clear, high voice, she always took the second part.
Rose, the farmer’s unmarried sister, who was a
year older than Barefoot, sang always the first
part, and it was understood, as a matter of course,
that Barefoot’s voice must help hers. Rose was
a proud, imperious person, who looked upon and
treated Amrie almost like a beast of burden, but
less before people than in secret; and as, in the
whole village, Amrie was considered of the
greatest service,—the person who kept every
thing in the farmer’s establishment in complete
order,—it was the principal concern of Rose to
glorify herself by telling people how much patience
was necessary to get along with Barefoot; how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
the goose-girl in every thing imitated her; and
how she bore with her merely out of compassion,
and that she might not expose herself to others.</p>

<p>One great object of banter, and of not always
well-chosen jokes, was Barefoot’s shoes. She continued
to go barefoot, or in winter only she wore
low-cut peasant’s boots; yet she took every half-year
the customary addition to her wages, of two
pairs of welted shoes. They stood upon a shelf in
her chamber, while Amrie bore herself as proudly
as though she wore them all at the same time.
Her shoes numbered six pairs, since Dami left her.
They were filled with straw, and from time to time
oiled to keep them soft.</p>

<p>Barefoot was now completely grown up; not
very tall, but well-proportioned, strong, and active.
She always dressed herself in poor materials, but
neatly and gracefully, for taste is the ornament of
poverty, that costs nothing, and that cannot be
purchased. But as Farmer Rodel held it for the
honor of his family, he insisted, on Sundays, that
she should put on a better dress to be seen by the
village. After church, Amrie quickly changed it
again, and went to sit with Mariann in her every-day
working-dress, or she stood over her flowers,
which she cherished in pots at her garret-window,
where pinks and the Rose Mariè flourished admirably.
Although she had taken from them many
grafts to plant upon the graves of her parents,
they always doubled their growth afterwards.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
The pinks, indeed, hung down in pretty spiral
tufts to the arbor-walk that went round the whole
house. The wide, inclined, straw-roof of the house,
formed an excellent protection for the flowers.
Barefoot never failed, when a warm summer shower
fell, to carry her flower-pots into the garden and
leave them near the rain-softened, motherly earth;
in particular a little Rose Mariè, that grew in an
extremely graceful manner, like a little tree. Barefoot
would close her right hand, and strike the
palm of the other hand over it, and say to herself,—“when
the wedding of my nearest friend
comes,—yes, when my Dami is married, then I
will lay thee out.” Another thought, one at which
she would have blushed in her sleep, sent the red
blood to her cheeks as she bent over the Rose
Mariè. She drew in her breath as though there
met her a faint perfume from the future. But she
would not suffer the thought to dwell a moment;
wildly and hastily thrusting the rose behind the
other larger plants, so that she could not see it,
she closed the window.</p>

<p>An alarm-bell sounded! “<span class="smcap">Fire!</span> at Schecken’s
in Hirlingen!” they soon cried. The fire-engine
was drawn out, and Barefoot went upon it, and the
firemen following.</p>

<p>“My Dami! my Dami!” she cried inwardly, all
the way; but it was day, and people are not burnt
in the day-time. And, in fact, as they reached Hirlingen,
the house was already burnt to the ground.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
At some distance from the house stood Dami, in an
orchard, fastening two beautiful well-formed horses
to a tree; while all around were collected horses,
oxen, cows, and heifers.</p>

<p>Barefoot got down, exclaiming, “Thank God,
thou art safe.” She ran to her brother, but he
would not speak to her, and with both hands laid
upon the neck of the horse, he concealed his face.</p>

<p>“What is the matter? Why do you not speak?
Have you met with any injury?”</p>

<p>“Not I—but the fire!”</p>

<p>“What has happened, then?”</p>

<p>“All my things are burnt; my clothes and the
little money I had saved. I have nothing now but
the clothes I have on.”</p>

<p>“And our father’s clothes, are they burnt?”</p>

<p>“Were they fire-proof?” asked Dami angrily.
“How can you ask such foolish questions?”</p>

<p>Barefoot could scarcely help weeping at her
brother’s unkindness, but she felt quickly that
misfortunes naturally make one harsh and bitter,
and she merely said,—</p>

<p>“Well, thank God that your life is spared. The
loss of our father’s clothes can never be repaired,
but they would at length have been worn out—then,
so—or so—” and she wept.</p>

<p>“All thy tattle is a cat’s-paw,” said Dami, and
kept stroking the horses. “Here I stand as
God made me. If the horses could speak, they
would tell a different story. But I was born to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
ill luck, however well I do, it is of no use, and
yet—” He could say no more—his voice failed
him.</p>

<p>“What then has happened?” asked Amrie.</p>

<p>“The horses, cows, and oxen—yes, all, not a
hoof of them has been burnt—the swine alone we
could not save. Look! the horse there above tore
my shirt as I drew him out of the stall; the near-handed
horse would not have hurt me—he knows
me! Ei! thou knowest me, Humple? Ei! we
know each other.” The horse thus spoken to, laid
his head over the neck of the other, and looked
earnestly at Dami, who continued,—</p>

<p>“When I went joyfully to inform the farmer that
I had saved all the animals, he said, ‘That was
nothing to him; they were all insured, and he
should have been paid more than their worth.’
Then I thought to myself, ‘Is it nothing that the
innocent animals should all be burnt? Is life nothing
when one is paid?’ The farmer must have
guessed my thoughts, for he asked, ‘You have, of
course, saved your clothes and things?’ ‘No!’ I
answered, ‘not a thread, for I sprang into the stable
first.’”</p>

<p>“The more fool you,” he said.</p>

<p>“‘How?’ I asked, ‘for if you were insured,
and the animals would have been paid for, my
clothes must also be paid for; the clothes also of
my late father, fourteen florins, my watch, and my
pipe.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>“Your pipe is smoked out,” he said; “my things
were insured, but not those of my servants.”</p>

<p>“I answered, ‘That is to be seen; I will try
what the law can do.’”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said he, “if that is your sort, you may
go at once. He who begins a lawsuit, has given
warning. I would have given you a couple of
florins, but now not a penny. Now be off!”</p>

<p>“And here I am; now I think I might take
this near-handed horse with me. I saved his life,
and he would willingly come with me. But I
have not learnt to steal, and I cannot help myself
thus. The best thing I can do is to spring into
that water and drown myself. I can never
come to any thing, and can never help myself
again.”</p>

<p>“But I have something, and I will help you,”
said Barefoot.</p>

<p>“No, that I’ll do no longer—no longer live
upon you. You also have to work hard.”</p>

<p>Barefoot succeeded in consoling her brother, so
that he consented to go home with her. But
scarcely had they gone a hundred steps, when the
favorite horse, having broken loose, came trotting
after them. Dami had to drive the animal he
loved so much back with stones.</p>

<p>Dami was so ashamed of his ill luck, that he was
unwilling to see any one; for it is the peculiarity
of weak natures that they cannot feel any strength
in themselves; when outwardly overcome, they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
are conquered inwardly—they look upon ill
success as a sign of their own weakness, and
if they cannot conceal that, they conceal themselves.</p>

<p>At the first houses of the village Dami stopped.
Mariann sent him a coat of her husband’s, who had
been shot; but Dami felt an unconquerable repugnance
to putting it on. Barefoot, who had praised
her father’s coat as something sacred and holy,
now found good reasons to prove that there was
nothing in a coat—that nothing could adhere to
it from its former wearer.</p>

<p>Mathew, the charcoal-burner, who lived not
far from Mariann, took Dami to help him in his
wood-splitting and coal-burning. To Dami this
secluded life was most welcome; he was waiting
only till he could be drafted for a soldier; then he
would enlist for life, and remain always a soldier.
“In the army,” he said, “is justice and order,
and no man has trouble from his own family;
food and clothing are provided, and when war
comes, a soldier’s sudden death is always the
best.”</p>

<p>This was the way he talked when Barefoot
came on Sundays to the charcoal kiln to see him,
and brought him food, and tobacco for his pipe.
She would often teach him how he could cook
better food at the wood-coals, and little puddings,
that he could himself prepare. But Dami would
only have things just as they happened, and insisted,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
although he might have improved his housekeeping,
upon living wretchedly, till the time
when he would shine out as a soldier. Barefoot
opposed this eternal looking forward to a coming
time, and letting the present slip away. She
knew that Dami indulged that secret idleness
which consisted in self-pity, and this she thought
would end in his becoming good-for-nothing.
Only with the utmost exertion could she induce
him to buy himself an axe out of his own earnings.
This was his father’s, which Mathew had
bought at the sale of Josenhans’ effects.</p>

<p>Barefoot often returned almost despairing from
the forest. This did not last long. The inward
trust, and native courageous gayety, which belonged
to her disposition, expressed itself voluntarily
in cheerful songs forever upon her lips;
and those who did not know her history would
never have remarked that Barefoot had now or
ever a single sorrow. The cheerfulness that arose
from an involuntary consciousness that her duty
was well performed, and all her leisure devoted to
the comfort of Mariann and Dami, impressed upon
her countenance a constant joyousness. None in
the house laughed as gayly as Barefoot. Old Rodel
said her laugh was just like the song of the
quail. She was always so helpful and respectful to
him, that he gave her to understand that he should
remember her in his will. Barefoot did not
trouble herself nor expect much from this. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
relied upon nothing but the wages, which were
justly hers, and whatever she performed beyond
this for others, she did from benevolence and a
generous disposition. Was not this to be a true
Sister of Charity?</p>

<p class="drop-cap">FARMER SCHECKEN’S house was rebuilt
handsomer than before the fire. With the
winter came the drawing for recruits, but never
was there such sorrow at drawing an exemption as
that Dami displayed. He was in despair, and
Amrie grieved with him, for she thought the
soldier’s discipline an excellent means to make
the indolent Dami more firm and steadfast. But
she said, “Take it as a sign that you must from
this time forth support yourself like a man. You
are like a little child that cannot feed himself,
but must have his food given him.”</p>

<p>“You would reproach me,” said Dami, “for
what you do for me.”</p>

<p>“No, indeed, that I did not mean. Do not
stand there so doleful, to see who will do something
for you, either good or bad; act for yourself!”</p>

<p>“That I will,” said Dami, “I will do something
that will astonish you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>For a long time he gave no hint of what he
had in his mind; he went boldly through the
village, and talked freely with every one, and
worked industriously in the forest at wood-splitting.
He had his father’s axe, and seemed with
it to have gained his father’s strength.</p>

<p>As Barefoot one day, in the early spring, met
him returning from the forest, he said, taking the
axe from his shoulder,—</p>

<p>“Where do you think this is going?”</p>

<p>“Into the wood,” answered his sister; “but it
cannot go alone—you must send it there.”</p>

<p>“You are right. But it is going to its brother;
one will strike above, and the other beneath, and
then there will be a crashing of trees like the
sound of a loaded cannon; you will not hear it—unless
you choose it. But none in this place will
hear it.”</p>

<p>“I do not understand one word,” said Barefoot.
“I am too old to guess riddles; speak plainly.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I am going to our uncle in America.”</p>

<p>“What—to-day?” said Barefoot, jokingly.
“Do you know what Martin, the mason’s son,
called to his mother? ‘Mother, throw me a
clean shirt out of the window, for I am going to
walk to America.’ Those who would fly away
so easily, stay where they are.”</p>

<p>“We shall see how long I stay here,” said
Dami, and turned without another word into the
coal-burner’s house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>Barefoot at first would have made herself merry
over Dami’s strange plan, but it would not succeed.
She felt that there was something serious
in it. At night, when all in the house were in
bed, she hastened to her brother in the forest,
and declared to him, once for all, “that she could
not go with him.”</p>

<p>She thought thus to turn him from his plan,
but he answered shortly,—</p>

<p>“Well, but I am not grown to thee.” He
seemed more decided than ever.</p>

<p>Barefoot felt again all the agitation of uncertainty,
which she had experienced in childhood;
but she went not now for counsel to the wild
service-tree, as though that could answer her
doubts, as out of all question the conclusion was
clear, “It is right for him to go; it is also right
for me to remain here.” She secretly rejoiced
that Dami could take so bold a resolution; it
indicated so much manly strength of mind; and
though it affected her deeply to be left alone in
the wide world, she thought it right and noble
that her brother should act with so much healthy
courage. Yet she did not entirely trust him, for
the next evening, when she met him, she said in
passing—“Say nothing to any one of your plan
of emigrating, for if you should not carry it out,
you will be laughed at.”</p>

<p>“You are right,” said Dami, “but not because
other people are to influence me; for as certainly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
as I have five fingers on this hand, so certainly I
shall go before the cherries are ripe; even if I
must beg or steal the means to go. Only one
thing I am sorry for, that I must go away and not
serve Schecken a trick that he should remember
during his whole life.”</p>

<p>“That is true man’s revenge”—Barefoot
hastened to say, “that is real wickedness of heart,
to leave behind one the memory of injury. There,
over there, lie the graves of our parents—come!
come with me, and repeat there, if you can, what
you have just said. Do you know who is the
most worthless of men? He who would injure
another. Give me the axe. You are not worthy
to hold in your hand what has once been in our
father’s. Give up the axe, or I know not what I
shall do. If you do not instantly tear out that
thought, both root and branch, from your soul, I
know not what I shall do! Give me the axe.
No one shall have it who talks of stealing and
murder. Give it to me, or I know not what I
shall do!”</p>

<p>Dami said in a whisper, “It was only a thought;
believe me, I did not mean it, I could not do it;
but as they always call me milksop, I thought for
once I would curse and threaten. You are right,
and if you wish it I will go to-night to Schecken,
and tell him that I harbor no malice, no bad
thoughts in my heart against him.”</p>

<p>“That is not necessary; that would be too<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
much, but since you are reasonable, I will help
you all I can.”</p>

<p>“It were best that you went with me.”</p>

<p>“No, that I cannot—I know not why, but I cannot!
I have made no vow that if you write me
you go on well with our uncle, that I will not follow
you; but it is so uncertain, so in the mist,
when one knows nothing; and then I do not willingly
change. I am very well here. Now let us
consider about your own affairs.”</p>

<p>It is the case with many emigrants, and it discloses
a dark side of human nature, that they take
what they hope may remain unpunished revenge.
With others, the first act in the New World is to
write home to the officers of justice, and reveal
secret crimes. It was on this account that Amrie
felt so much excitement lest her brother should
associate himself with those who strike in the
dark. She felt doubly joyful when Dami conquered
his desire for revenge. No benevolent
deed is so refreshing to the soul, as that of turning
another from vice and error.</p>

<p>With her usual clearness of intellect, Amrie
weighed all the circumstances. Her uncle’s wife
had written that they were doing well—thus they
knew the place of their residence. Dami’s savings
were very small, her own would not go far, and
though Dami thought the parish were bound to
pay something, his sister would not hear of it—“That,”
she said, “should be the last recourse, if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
all others failed.” She did not explain her intentions,
but her first thought had been to write to
Farmer Landfried’s wife. She feared how such a
begging letter would strike the farmer’s wife, who
perhaps had no ready money. Then she thought
of Farmer Rodel, who had promised her a place in
his testament: she would ask him to give her now
what he intended for her, if it were ever so little.
Then it occurred to her, that perhaps Schecken,
who was now so prosperous, might be moved to
lend her a small sum—she said nothing to Dami
of all this, but as she collected his garments, and
with much trouble persuaded Mariann to let her
have upon trust a piece of her treasured linen for
shirts, which she sat up all night to cut out and
make,—all these preparations made Dami tremble,—he
had indeed acted as though his plan of
emigrating was unalterable, and yet it seemed to
him now as though he was constrained and forced
by the stronger will of his sister to carry his plan
into execution. She even appeared to him hard-hearted,
as though she wished to get rid of him.
He did not venture to say this distinctly—he only
brought forward little difficulties, which Barefoot
treated as necessary obstacles to leave-taking that
would vanish when he went. She hastened to
Farmer Rodel, expressly desiring that he would give
her now what he promised to leave her in his will.</p>

<p>The old farmer asked, “Why are you so pressing?
Can you not wait? What is the matter?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>“Nothing—but I cannot wait.”</p>

<p>She then told him that she wanted to fit out her
brother, who was going to America.</p>

<p>This was a lucky excuse for the old farmer;
he could make his stinginess pass for wise forethought
and consideration for her; he declared he
would not give a single farthing to help her to
sacrifice herself for her brother. Barefoot entreated
him to speak to Farmer Schecken. At last
he consented, and boasted that he, a stranger, was
going to beg of a stranger, for a stranger, but he
put it off from day to day. Amrie would not spare
him, and he, at last, took the path to Schecken’s
farm. As it might have been foreseen, he came
back with empty hands; for when Schecken asked
what he intended to give, and he answered,—</p>

<p>“For the present, nothing!”</p>

<p>Schecken said, “He was also of the same mind.”</p>

<p>When poor Amrie revealed to Mariann her sorrow
at the hard-heartedness of men, the old woman
broke out with angry emotion,—</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said, “just so are men; if to-morrow
one were to cast himself into the water, and he
were drawn out dead, every one would say, ‘Had he
only told me what was the matter, what he wanted,
I would so gladly have helped him! What would
I not give to bring him back to life!’ but to help
him while he was yet alive, not one would move a
finger!”</p>

<p>Strange as it was, though the whole labor of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
thing rested upon Barefoot, she learnt to bear it
cheerfully. One must depend on one’s self alone,
was her inward resolve, and instead of being disheartened
by all her difficulties, she was only made
stronger and firmer. She collected every thing
that she could turn to money; she carried the
necklace she had formerly received from Landfried’s
wife to the widow of the former Sacristan,
who solaced her widowhood by lending upon
pledges; even the ducat, she formerly threw back
from the Surveyor, in the churchyard, she now demanded
back again. Still more surprising, Rodel
himself offered to demand of the village council,
in which he sat, a certain sum for the service of
Dami. With the public money he was always generous,
as well as honest.</p>

<p>After a few days, he alarmed Barefoot by telling
her that every thing was settled with the council,
upon the condition that Dami should give up all
claims to a home in the village. This had been
understood from the first, but now that it was
made a condition, it seemed frightful to Barefoot,
that Dami should no longer have a home with her,
or in any place. She said nothing of her thoughts
to him, and he again appeared gay and good-humored.
Mariann especially, encouraged him;
she would gladly have sent the whole village to
foreign countries, that they might learn something
of her John. She now firmly believed that he had
crossed the sea. Raven Zacky told her that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
salt flood of the sea prevented the tears from flowing
for one who was upon the other shore.</p>

<p>Amrie obtained permission from the farmer to
go with her brother to the next town, to make
arrangement with the agent for his passage. They
were astonished to find it had already been done.
The village council had settled every thing, and
while Dami enjoyed the privilege of poverty, its
duties were exacted from him. From the deck of
the ship, before it sailed into the wide sea, he must
sign a certificate of his departure; not till then
was the money paid.</p>

<p>The brother and sister returned full of sadness;
they went silently into the village. Dami was
oppressed with the feeling that something would
happen, because he had once said so, and Barefoot
was deeply grieved that her brother, at last,
seemed to be thrust hastily away.</p>

<p>When they reached the entrance of the village,
and the sign-post, upon which were the names of
the village and the district, Dami said aloud,
“Thou that standest here, God keep thee! Thou
wilt be no longer my home, and all the people
here will be no more to me than thou art.”</p>

<p>Barefoot wept. She determined it should be the
last time till after Dami had gone. She kept her
resolution, and the village people said, “Barefoot
had no heart, for her eyes were dry when her
brother departed!” They would have seen her
weep. What were the tears that were shed in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
secret to them? She took care to keep strong
and active. Only on the few last days, when
Dami’s departure was delayed, did she neglect her
usual work. She would be always with her
brother. When Rose scolded her, she said only,
“You are right,” and ran again to Dami. She
would not lose a minute while he was there.
Every hour she thought she could do something,
or say something that would last him his life long;
then she tormented herself that she could say only
common things, and that she had so often disagreed
with him.</p>

<p>Oh, those hours of leave-taking! How they
press upon the heart; how all the past and the
future is crowded together into one agonizing moment,
and only one look, and one embrace, must
express all!</p>

<p>Amrie gained time for more words. When she
counted her brother’s new shirts, she said, “These
are good clean shirts; keep thyself good and pure
within them.” As she packed every thing into
the sack upon which their father’s name was
marked, she said,—“Bring this back again full of
money, and we shall see how gladly they will restore
to you all your rights. The farmer’s Rose,
if she remains single, will spring over seven houses
after thee.” When she laid her father’s axe in the
great chest she said,—“Oh! how smooth the
handle is, how often has our father’s hand gone
over it. It seems as though I felt his hand still<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
upon it. So, now, I have a good motto,—‘Sack
and Axe,’ working and saving—with these, one
becomes hearty, and healthy and happy. God
protect thee! Say often to yourself, ‘Sack and
Axe.’ I will also often say it. This shall be our
mutual thought; our call to each other when we
are far,—far apart,—till you write to me, or come
to fetch me, or—as God will have it. ‘Sack and
Axe.’ This contains all. All that we think, and
all that we gain.”</p>

<p>When Dami sat in the wagon, and for the last
time she gave him her hand, which she could not
draw away till he started, then, in a clear voice,
she cried after him,—</p>

<p>“Remember, ‘Sack and Axe!’” He looked
back, nodded, and he was gone!</p>

<small>AN UNBIDDEN GUEST.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">PRAISED be America! cried the night-watch,
when he called the hour of the night, to the
amusement of the village, many nights after Dami
went, instead of the usual “Praised be God!”</p>

<p>Raven Zacky, who was not well off himself,
and always scolding about the poor, said at going
out of church on Sunday, and also when sitting
on the long bench before the village inn,—“Columbus
was a true savior for us. Yes, America
is the slop-pail for the Old World. We shake into
it what cannot be used in the kitchen. Cabbage
and turnip—all will answer for those who dwell
in the castle behind the house, and understand
French, <i>oui! oui!</i> It makes good food for
them.”</p>

<p>Through poverty of other materials, the departure
of Dami was for a long time the subject
of conversation in the village, and those who
belonged to the village council praised its wisdom
in freeing itself of one who would certainly have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
become a charge to the parish. For he who
drives many trades will certainly at last drive to
ruin.</p>

<p>There were naturally many good-natured people
who repeated all they said of her brother, and
their ill-natured jokes to Barefoot. But she only
laughed, and when there came from Bremen a
beautiful letter from Dami (they could not believe
he could have written it so correctly), she
had her triumph in the eyes of all, and read her
letter many times over to them. In her heart she
was sad at having lost such a brother, perhaps
forever. She also reproached herself that she had
not put him more forward, as now he showed what
a brave fellow he was, and, moreover, so good.
Now, he who would have taken leave of the whole
village as he would of the sign-post, filled a whole
page with greetings for every one. He called
them the “dear,” the “good,” the “brave.” Barefoot
gained much praise whenever she showed
these greetings. She always pointed to the place,
with “See, there it stands in black and white.”</p>

<p>Amrie was for a long time quiet and reserved;
she appeared to repent that she had let her brother
go, or that she had not gone with him. Formerly,
whether in the house or the barn, in the kitchen
or the chamber, she was always singing, and when
she went out with the scythe on her shoulder, she
was still singing. Now they heard no sound from
her lips. Some burthen held back her melody.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
Yet there was a time when her songs were heard
again; when she put the Rodel children to sleep,
she sang softly; and long after they were asleep,
her voice was heard in tender melodies. Then
she would hasten to Mariann, and fetch her wood
and water, and all else that she needed.</p>

<p>On Sunday afternoons, when all were seeking
amusement, Barefoot remained still and motionless
at the house door, looking far into the wide space,
and into the sky. She saw where the birds were
flying, and lost herself in dreams,—sometimes of
Dami, where he was, and how it was with him;
then she would fix her glance upon an over-turned
plough, or upon a hen that buried itself in the
sand. When a carriage passed through the
village, she would look up and say, as to herself,—“They
are going to some one; but upon all the
streets of the wide world there is nobody coming
to me—nobody thinks of me. Could I not hear
them even here?” And then it seemed as though
she expected something. Her heart beat quicker,
as though somebody was coming, and involuntarily
came from her lips,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“The little brooks, they freely take</div>
<div class="indent">Their courses to the sea;</div>
<div class="verse">But ah! no friend upon the earth</div>
<div class="indent">Can share his heart with me.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>“I would I were as old as you are,” she said one
day, when, dreaming thus, she entered Mariann’s
cottage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>“Be glad that your wish is not the truth,” said
the other. “When I was of your age, I was
merry, and weighed down at the Plaster Mill a
hundred and thirty-two pounds.”</p>

<p>“You are always the same, always cheerful. It
is not so with me.”</p>

<p>“Ah, simpleton! Do not fret away your youth;
no one can give it back to you. Age comes of
itself.”</p>

<p>Mariann easily succeeded in consoling Barefoot.
Only when she was alone an unwonted timidity
oppressed her. What could it be?</p>

<p>Strange rumors were in the village. For some
days it had been said, that in Endringen there was
to be a wedding, such as there had not been in the
memory of man. The eldest daughter of Dominic
and Amelia was to marry a rich timber-merchant
of Murgthal, they said, and there were to be gay
doings, such as they never had before.</p>

<p>The day came ever nearer. When two girls
met, one would draw the other behind the hedge,
or the haystack, and there was no end to the talk,
although they were both in a prodigious hurry.
They said people were coming from Oberland
and from Murgthal, and from thirty leagues distant,
for the family had extensive connections. At
the village fountain there was lively excitement.
No young girl would acknowledge that she was
going to have a new dress, that she might enjoy
the surprise the next day when it appeared. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
the hurry of question and answer, they forgot to
draw their water, and Barefoot, who came last,
went first away, bearing her full bucket. What
was the dance to her? And yet she seemed to
hear music in the air all around her.</p>

<p>The next day she had much to do in the house,
and constant running, for she had to dress Rose.
Rose had a quantity of hair, and the most was to
be made of it. To-day she would try something
new; something in the Maria Theresa style, as
here in the country they called a braid of fourteen
strands. Barefoot succeeded in accomplishing this
difficult work of art; but scarcely was it finished,
when Rose, in a rage, tore it down, and looked
wildly out from the hair hanging over her face.
Still, she was beautiful and stately in this disorder,
and she knew it. “I will never marry into a
family where they keep less than four horses,”
she said, haughtily. In fact, she had many
suitors among the farmers’ sons, but she seemed
not inclined to choose among them. She now decided
upon the country custom of two braids down
her back, ornamented with red ribbons reaching
to the ground. She stood there ready dressed,
and wanted only a nosegay to complete her adornment.
She had allowed her own flowers to
wither; and, spite of all Barefoot could say, she
must rob all the blossoms from the beautifully
cherished flowers in the window. At length she
also demanded the little dwarf Rose-Mariè; but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
Barefoot would be torn to pieces before she would
cut that. Rose scoffed and laughed, scolded, and
called her “only a simple Goose-girl, who was now
so selfish, though they had taken her into the
family through charity.” Barefoot said not a
word, but she gave Rose a look which made her
cast down her eyes. Just then a red rosette had
become loose upon her left shoe, and Amrie knelt
down to fasten it; when partly in joke, and partly
through repentance of her ill-nature, Rose exclaimed,
“I have taken a fancy, Barefoot, that you
shall also go to the dance to-day.”</p>

<p>“Do not laugh at me,” said Barefoot. “What
have I done?”</p>

<p>“I am not laughing,” Rose declared. “Once in
a life you shall dance, for you are also a young girl,
and there will be some of your condition there.
Our stable-boy is going, and some peasant’s son
will dance with you. I will see that you have a
partner.”</p>

<p>“Leave me in peace,” said Amrie, still kneeling,
“or I will prick you.”</p>

<p>“Rose is right,” exclaimed the farmer’s wife,
who had till now been silent; “I will never say a
good word for you again, if you do not consent to
go to this dance. Come, sit down, and I, for once,
will be your dressing-maid.”</p>

<p>Crimson blushes succeeded each other over
Barefoot’s face, as she sat there, served by her
mistress; and when she turned her hair back from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
her forehead, she felt as though she should sink
down for shame. Her mistress said, “I will dress
your hair as the Algäuer girls wear it. That will
be very becoming to you, for you look like an
Algäuer—so plump and brown. Yes, you look
like one of the daughters of Farmer Landfried of
Zusmarshofen.”</p>

<p>“Why so! How like her?” asked Barefoot;
and her whole frame trembled. Why was it that
she should just now be reminded of this friend
that, from a child, she had never forgotten; and
who, from that time, had remained in her memory
like a benevolent fairy in a fairy tale. She had no
ring that she could turn to make her appear. In
her mind only could she conjure her hither, and
that only involuntarily.</p>

<p>“Keep quiet, or I shall pull thy hair,” said
her mistress. Barefoot sat motionless,—scarcely
breathing. As she sat there with her hands
pressed together, and her mistress sometimes
bending over her, she felt her warm breath on her
face—she seemed to herself as though she were
suddenly enchanted. She said not a word, and
sank her glances humbly to the ground, lest she
should scare away the enchantment.</p>

<p>“Would that I could dress you thus for your
own wedding,” said her mistress, who to-day overflowed
with benevolence. “I would give thee a
right honest farmer, and no one would be taken in
by thee. But now-a-days things do not happen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
thus. Money runs after money. However, do not
be discouraged; as long as I live, you shall want
for nothing; and if I should die—for I have sad
thoughts when I think of my heavy hour—promise
that you will never leave my children, but be a
mother to them.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Heavens! how can you have such
thoughts?” cried Barefoot, and tears ran down
her cheeks. “It is a sin! for it is sinful to allow
bad thoughts to come into one’s mind.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes! you are right,” said her mistress.
“But wait—sit still! I will fetch my necklace.
You must wear that on your neck.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, no! I can wear nothing which is not
my own. I should sink to the earth with shame.”</p>

<p>“Yes! but you cannot go thus. Perhaps you
have something of your own that you can wear.”</p>

<p>Barefoot related that she had once a necklace
which she received when a child, from Madam
Landfried; but to provide funds for Dami’s emigration,
she had pledged it to the Sacristan’s
widow.</p>

<p>Her mistress exacted a promise that she would
not move, nor look at herself in the glass, till she
came back, and hastened forth to reclaim the ornament,
and herself became surety for the payment.</p>

<p>What timidity ran through the soul of Barefoot,
as she sat there waiting. She, the servant, so
humbly served—and, in fact, she sat as though
enchanted. When she thought of the dance she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
trembled—she was treated so kindly; and who
could tell that she might not be thrust out of the
dance, with none to care for her, and all her outward
ornaments and her inward pleasure be in
vain. “No,” she said to herself, “if I have only
that which I now enjoy, it is sufficient. If I must
immediately undress and remain at home, I have
still had the pleasure.”</p>

<p>Her mistress came in with the necklace in her
hand. Praise of the ornament, and blame of the
Sacristan’s widow, who could take such shameful
interest from a poor girl, were strangely blended
together. She promised herself to pay the pledge,
and gradually deduct it from Barefoot’s wages.</p>

<p>Now, at last, she was permitted to look at herself.
Her mistress held the glass before her, and
from the expression of both there shone, as it
were, a mutual hymn of joy.</p>

<p>“I do not know myself! I do not know myself!”
cried Barefoot, pressing both hands upon
her face. “Oh, that my mother could see me
thus! But she will certainly bless you for being
so good to me. Yes, from Heaven she will support
you in your heavy hour. You need fear
nothing.”</p>

<p>“Ah, a different face, not that melancholy one,
must go to the dance,” said her mistress. “But it
will come when you hear the music.”</p>

<p>“I think I hear it now,” said Barefoot. “Yes—listen—there
it is.” In fact, there now came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
on through the village the leading wagon, covered
with green branches, in which sat all the musicians.
Raven Zacky stood up in the midst and
blew a trumpet.</p>

<p>It was time to go, and all the village hastened
after. Bernese chaises, with one horse and with
two, from this village and from the neighborhood,
passing through, were driven as though running
for a wager. Rose sat on the front seat with her
brother, while Barefoot went in the basket behind.
As long as they were in the village she
kept her eyes cast down; only when passing the
house of her parents she looked up, as Mariann
stood there to greet her. The old cock upon the
wood-pile crowed, and the service-tree nodded a
“God bless you, on the way.”</p>

<p>Now they pass through the valley where old
Manz was breaking stones, and now over the
Holder Common, where an old woman took care
of the geese. Barefoot gave her a friendly nod.
“Oh, Heavens,” she thought, “how did I come
to this—that I can sit here so proud and well
dressed. It is but an hour’s ride to Endringen.
It seems as though we had but just started, and
we must already alight.”</p>

<p>Rose was immediately surrounded and greeted
by friends. “Is that a sister of your brother’s
wife that you have brought with you?” her
friends asked.</p>

<p>“No! it is only our maid,” said Rose. Some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
beggars from Holdenbrunn, who were there, looked
astonished; and after observing her a long
time, cried “Ei! yes; that is Barefoot.”</p>

<p>These little words, “only our maid,” sunk
deeply into Barefoot’s mind; but she recovered
herself, and smiling, said to herself, “Let not a
little word spoil thy pleasure. If you begin so,
you will continually tread upon thorns.”</p>

<p>Rose took her aside and said, “Go now upon
the dancing-platform, or wherever you find acquaintance.
By and by when the music begins, I
will see you again.”</p>

<p>Yes, there stood Barefoot, as though deserted.
It seemed to her as though she had stolen her
clothes, and had no right to be there. She was an
intruder. “What was I thinking of,” she asked
herself, “when I consented to come to a marriage-feast?”
and she gladly would have returned home.
She went in and out through the village, and passed
the beautiful house that was built for the Brosis,
and where there was much life to-day; for the
mother of the Brosis, with her sons and daughters,
had their summer residence there. Barefoot went
again into the village, walked about, but would
not look round, though she longed to have some
one call her, that she might find a companion.</p>

<p>At the end of the village she met a genteel
horseman upon a white horse, who was riding
into the village. He wore the dress of a farmer of
another part of the country, and sat on his horse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
proudly. He stopped, and while he held out his
riding-whip in his right hand, he patted with the
left the neck of his horse. “Good-morning, pretty
maiden,” he said. “Already tired of the dance?”</p>

<p>“Of unnecessary questions I am already tired,”
she answered.</p>

<p>The horseman rode on, and Amrie sat a long
time behind a hazel-hedge, where thoughts crowded
upon her, and her cheeks crimsoned with shame
and anger at the petulant answer she had given to
a harmless question. Perplexity, and an incomprehensible
internal agitation came over her. Involuntarily
the song of the lovers came to her lips:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“There were two lovers in Allgäu,</div>
<div class="verse">They were to each other so dear.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>Full of joy she had begun the day, and now she
wished herself dead. “Here, behind this hedge,”
she said, “to fall asleep and wake no more. Oh,
how delightful that would be. There is no more
joy for me on earth. Why strive to obtain it?
How the crickets chirp in the grass, while a warm
perfume arises from it. The hedge-sparrows
twitter continually as though they strove to bring
out deeper, and fresher, and more musical warblings;
as though they could not express or say
what out of the whole heart they had to say. Far
above sing the larks. Every bird sings for himself—none
listen—no bird checks another, and
yet, all——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>Never in her life before had she fallen asleep in
the day-time—and now, to sleep in the bright
morning! She had drawn her handkerchief over
her eyes, but the sunbeams kissed her closed lips,
that in sleep were pressed poutingly together, and
the light red upon her chin grew deeper. She
slept perhaps an hour, then starting, awoke. The
horseman upon the white horse had ridden back,
and the horse was pressing with both fore feet
upon her breast.</p>

<p>It was only a dream. Amrie looked around as
though she had suddenly fallen from heaven.
She scarcely knew where she was, but the sound
of the music quickly aroused all her faculties, and
she went with new strength back to the village
where increased gayety inspired every one. She
had rested, and all was forgotten that had annoyed
her in the morning. Now should partners come,
she could dance till morning, without rest or
weariness.</p>

<p>A fresh bloom, like that of a child, lay upon her
cheeks, and every one looked astonished at her
beauty. She went to the dancing-platform. The
music sounded from an empty room. There were
no dancers there, only the girls that had come to
wait upon the guests, were twirling round with
each other. Raven Zacky looked long at Amrie—then
shook his head—he appeared not to know
her. She met Dominic, the farmer from the
Ridge, who that day was in his glory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>“Pardon me,” he said, “Does the maiden belong
to the marriage-guests?”</p>

<p>“No, I am only a maid, and came with the
daughter of the house, Rose, from Rodel Farm.”</p>

<p>“Good. Go up then to the farm to my wife,
and tell her that I sent you to help her. They
cannot have too many hands to-day.”</p>

<p>“As you please, willingly,” said Amrie, and
went immediately. On the way she could not
help thinking that Dominic had once been a servant—and
now— But such a thing does not
happen once in a hundred years. It cost much
blood also, to elevate him to this rank.</p>

<p>Amelia welcomed the newly-arrived help, and
drawing off Amrie’s gay spencer, she gave her a
great apron with a breast cover. She must refresh
herself with food before she began work. Amrie
consented, and with the first word, won the good
will of Amelia. “I am hungry,” she said, “and
I will not give you trouble to press me to eat.”</p>

<p>Amrie remained in the kitchen, and gave such
excellent assistance to the waiters, and knew so
well how all the dishes should be arranged, that
Dominic’s wife said, “You two Amries, you and
my niece Amrie, can now manage every thing so
well, that I will repair to the guests.”</p>

<p>Amrie, from Siebenhöfen, the niece, who by all
the neighborhood was called proud and haughty,
was so wonderfully friendly and condescending to
our Amrie, that Amelia said to her, “It is a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
pity you are not a young man, for I believe Amrie
would marry you at once, and not send you off as
she does all her other suitors.”</p>

<p>“I have a brother at her service,” said Amrie;
“but he is in America.”</p>

<p>“There let him stay,” said the other Amrie.
“It is a pity we could not send all the young
fellows there, and we remain by ourselves.”</p>

<p>Barefoot would not leave the kitchen till every
thing was in its place. When she drew off her
apron, her dress was as clean and unwrinkled as
when she first put it on.</p>

<p>“You must be tired, and not able to dance,”
said her friend, as, with a present, Amrie took
leave.</p>

<p>“Why tired? This is only play. Believe me,
I am better for having done something to-day. I
could not be happy to pass a whole day in amusement;
this was certainly the reason I was so
melancholy this morning. Something was the
matter; but now I am just in the humor for gayety.
I could dance all day, could I but find partners.”</p>

<p>Amelia thought she could show Barefoot no
greater honor, than to take her as an equal all over
the house, and into the bride’s chamber, where
she showed her the large chest with the wedding-presents.
Then she opened the tall, blue painted
presses, with the name and the year marked upon
them, all filled with the dowry of numerous pieces<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
of linen tied with gay ribbons, and with borders
worked with pinks. In the clothes-presses were
at least thirty dresses, and beside the high beds,
the cradle, the distaff and beautiful spindles, it was
hung round with children’s playthings, presented
by her young companions.</p>

<p>“Ah,” said Barefoot, “how happy is such a child,
in such a house!”</p>

<p>“Art thou envious?” asked Amelia; then remembering
that she was showing all these things
to a poor girl, she added, “Believe me, these
things do not make one happy. Many are happy
who have not received even a stocking from their
parents.”</p>

<p>“Ah, yes, I know that. I am not envious of
these riches, but rather that your child has you
and so many friends to thank for all these, and for
all she has received from them. Such garments,
the gift of a mother, must keep one doubly warm.”</p>

<p>Amelia showed her benevolence towards Barefoot,
by going with her to the door of the court-yard,
and treating her with as much respect as
though she had eight horses in the stall.</p>

<p>All was lively confusion, when Amrie came
again upon the dancing-ground. She remained at
first, standing timidly upon the platform. Where
now were the troops of children, who formerly
enjoyed here a foretaste of the joys that awaited
them in after-life. Ah! indeed, all that is now
forbidden by the High States Government. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
Church and School Commission have banished the
children. They dare not turn in the waltz, as they
did in Amrie’s childhood. This is also a quiet
sword thrust from the green-cloth.</p>

<p>Over the now empty floor, where a guest occasionally
passed, walked up and down a solitary
policeman. When he saw Amrie coming, as it
were, beaming with light and joy, he went up to
her, and said,—</p>

<p>“Good-evening, Amrie! so you are here
also?”</p>

<p>Amrie trembled, and turned pale as death.
Had she done any thing wrong? Had she gone
into the stable with a bare lighted candle? She
examined her whole life as far as she could remember,
and yet he was as familiar as though she
were already a transported criminal. She stood
trembling as though her guilt were manifest. At
last she said,—“Thank you, I know nothing
about it, or why we are so intimate. Do you want
any thing?”</p>

<p>“Oh, ho! How proud we are! I shall not
eat you! Will you give me a plain answer.
Why are you so angry?”</p>

<p>“I am not angry. I would not hurt anybody.
I am only a stupid girl.”</p>

<p>“Do not pretend to be so innocent.”</p>

<p>“How do you know any thing about me?”</p>

<p>“Because you flaunt round so with the light.”</p>

<p>“Where? When? How do I flaunt round with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
a light? I always take a lantern when I go into
the stable.”</p>

<p>The policeman laughed, and said,—“There!
there, with your brown sparklers. There you
flaunt with the light—your eyes—they are like
two fire-balls.”</p>

<p>“Get out of the way then, lest I burn you.
You may be blown up with the powder in your
pocket-flask.”</p>

<p>“There is nothing there,” said the policeman,
embarrassed. “But you have singed me already.”</p>

<p>“I do not see it. You are all whole. Enough
of this. Let me go.”</p>

<p>“I do not keep you. You may live to torment
some poor man yet.”</p>

<p>“No one need have me,” said Amrie, and
escaped as though a chain which held her had
suddenly broken. She stood in the door where
many spectators had gathered, and as a new tune
began, she rocked backward and forward in harmony
with the melody. The consciousness of
having trumped the policeman, made her contented
with the whole world. He soon appeared again,
however, and placing himself behind Amrie, addressed
every word to her. She did not answer,
and appeared not to hear him, while she nodded
to the dancers as they waltzed near her. At
length he said,—“When I make up my mind to
marry, I will take thee.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>“How take me?” she answered. “If I give
myself, it will not be to thee!”</p>

<p>The policeman was glad to get any answer, and
he continued, “If I only were allowed to dance, I
would instantly dance with you.”</p>

<p>“I cannot dance,” said Amrie; and as the music
ceased, she pressed through to find a retired spot,
where she could remain unseen. She heard those
behind her say, “She can dance, and better than
any girl in the country.”</p>

<small>ONLY ONE DANCE.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">RAVEN ZACHY, from the music stage,
reached his glass to Barefoot. She touched
it with her lips and gave it back, when he said,
“If you dance, Amrie, I will play with the whole
power of my instrument, so that the angels shall
come down to listen.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Amrie, half in sport and half in
sadness; “but if no angel come down to ask me, I
fear I shall have no partner.” And now she considered,
Why it was necessary to have a policeman
at a dance? Then she thought, “He is a
man like other men, although he wears a sword
and a laced hat, and before he became a policeman,
he was a young fellow like the others. It must be
vexatious, that he is not allowed to dance. But
what is all this to me? I also must look on, and
I am not paid for it.”</p>

<p>A short time after, they were more quiet and
moderate upon the dancing-ground, for the “English
Lady,” (thus in the village they called Agy,)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
the wife of Councillor Severin, came with her children
to the dance. The respectable timber-merchant
called for champagne; a glass was presented
to Agy, and she drank to the happiness of the
young couple. She knew how to please every one
by a graceful word or two. Upon the faces of all
there was an expression of satisfaction. She
touched her lips to many of the flower-crowned
glasses, presented to her by the young fellows.
Also the old women in the neighborhood of
Barefoot had much to say in praise of the
“English Lady.” They stood up long before
she reached, and exchanged a word or two with
them.</p>

<p>As soon as Agy had passed on, the jubilee, with
singing, dancing, and loud music, began again with
new strength.</p>

<p>Farmer Rodel’s upper clerk came to Amrie, and
she trembled, full of expectation that he would
ask her to dance; but he only said, “Please, Barefoot,
hold my pipe till I have gone through this
dance?” Then many of the young girls from her
village came to her; from one she received a
jacket, from another a handkerchief, a neck-ribbon,
a house-key. She held them all, and still larger
grew her burthen, as each dance succeeded the
other. She laughed at her own situation, for no
one came for her.</p>

<p>Now there was a waltz played so soft and tender,
that it seemed as though they might float<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
upon it; and now a polka, so wild and gay, that
Hie! away they went springing and stamping, all
eyes sparkling, and all breathing joy. The old
women, who sat in the corners, complained of the
heat and dust, but none went home.</p>

<p>See! Amrie started. Her glance is arrested
by a handsome young man, who, in the confusion,
walks proudly up the room. It is the horseman
she met in the morning,—the one she answered
so peevishly. All eyes are turned upon him, as
with his left hand behind, and with the right
holding a silver-mounted pipe, he walks up and
down, his silver watch-seals swinging here and
there. How handsome is his black velvet jacket,
his full, black velvet breeches, and his crimson
waistcoat. But more beautiful than all is his well-shaped
head, with close curled brown hair. His
forehead above the eyes is white as snow, although
his face is brown, and a full light beard covers
cheeks and chin.</p>

<p>“That is a statesman,” said one of the old
women.</p>

<p>“And what heavenly blue eyes,” said another.
“They are at the same time so roguish and so
good-hearted!”</p>

<p>“Where can he come from?” said a third.
“He is not of these parts.”</p>

<p>And a fourth added, “He is certainly a wooer
for Amrie.”</p>

<p>The young man passed more than once up and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
down through the hall, apparently searching with
his eyes, when suddenly he stopped, not far from
Barefoot. He nodded to her. Amrie trembled,
and a burning heat ran through her veins; but
she did not move. Ah, no, he certainly nodded to
some one behind her. He does not mean her. She
made room for him to pass. He seeks another.</p>

<p>“No, it is thee!” said the young man, offering
his hand. “Wilt thou?”</p>

<p>Amrie could not speak; but what need of
words? She threw quickly all she had in her
hand into the corner,—jackets, handkerchiefs,
tobacco-pipes, house-keys.</p>

<p>They stood side by side, and the young man
threw a dollar to the musicians. When Raven
Zacky saw Amrie by the side of the stranger, he
made the walls tremble with his music. Not more
joyful can it sound to the blessed at the day of
judgment, than now in the ears of Amrie.</p>

<p>She turned she knew not how. She was borne
away by the stranger from all surrounding objects.
She floated upon air, and it seemed as though
they were alone, hovering therein. In truth, they
both danced so well, that involuntarily all the
others stopped to look at them.</p>

<p>“We are alone,” said Amrie; and immediately
after she felt the warm breath of her partner, who
answered,—</p>

<p>“Oh that we were alone! Alone in the world.
Why cannot we dance on so, till we die?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>“It seems to me exactly,” said Amrie, “as though
we were two doves soaring in the air Ju hu, up in
the Heavens!”</p>

<p>“Ju hu!” shouted the young man, so loud,
that his voice seemed to rise in the air like a
rocket.</p>

<p>Still more blessedly they swung round, till Amrie
said, “Stay; has not the music stopped? Do
they yet play? I do not hear them.”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed, they are playing still. Do you
not hear now?”</p>

<p>“Ah, now, yes,” said Amrie; and she held
her breath. Her partner thought she might be
exhausted and dizzy. He led her to a table, and
gave her refreshment, but still held her hand;
and taking into the other hand the Swedish coin
that hung by her necklace, he said, “This is in
a good place.”</p>

<p>“It came from a good hand,” answered Amrie.
“I received the present when I was a little
child.”</p>

<p>“From a relation?”</p>

<p>“No; the lady is not related to me.”</p>

<p>“That dance has done you good, it seems.”</p>

<p>“Oh, so much! But only think how many
may be dancing the whole year, and without
music. And here it is so much better.”</p>

<p>“You are plump,” said the stranger, jokingly.
“You must have good food.”</p>

<p>“It is not the food,” said Amrie, “but the appetite
for it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>The stranger nodded; and after a while he said,
inquiringly, “You are the farmer’s daughter—of——?”</p>

<p>“No; I am a servant,” said Amrie; and looked
him steadily in the face; but he would not
cast down his eyes—the eyelashes trembled, but
he looked steadily at her. This contest and victory
was the image of what passed within. After
this self-conquest, he said, “Come, shall we have
another dance?” He held firmly her hand, and
their happiness was renewed; but this time more
calmly and steadily. They both felt that this
elevation of their souls into heaven must come to
an end. Resulting from this thought, Amrie said,
“We have been happy together, even if through
our whole life long we should never meet again,
and neither of us know the name of the other.”</p>

<p>The young man nodded, and said simply,
“Yes.”</p>

<p>Amrie, embarrassed, said again, after a while,
“What we have once enjoyed, no one can ever
take from us; and whoever thou art, never repent
that you have given a poor girl for her life long
the memory of a happy hour.”</p>

<p>“I do not repent,” said the young man. “But
you—have you not repented the short answer
you gave me this morning?”</p>

<p>“Ah, yes; there you are right,” said Amrie.</p>

<p>The young man asked, “Will you trust me so
far as to walk in the field?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“And will you trust me?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“What will your relations say?”</p>

<p>“I am answerable to none but myself. I am an
orphan.”</p>

<p>Hand in hand they both left the dancing-hall.
Barefoot heard whispering and tittering behind
her, and kept her eyes fixed upon the ground.
She was asking herself, “Have I not been too
confident?”</p>

<p>Without, in the cornfield, where the first tender
leaves were beginning to shoot from their protecting
sheath, they looked silently at each other. No
word was spoken. At length the young man
seemed to ask, as to himself,—“If I might only
know how it happens, that some people at the first
glance can be so—so—confidential, as it were.
How they can understand what the face alone at
first reveals?”</p>

<p>“There,” said Amrie, “we have saved a soul;
for you know that when two people have the
same thought, at the same moment, a poor soul
is saved. At your first word I had the same
thought.”</p>

<p>“Indeed! And do you know why it is so?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“And will you tell me?”</p>

<p>“Why not? Listen! I have been goose-herd.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>At this word the young man started, but he
made believe rub his eyes, and Barefoot, unembarrassed,
continued,—“When one sits and lies
down so long in the fields alone, they think of a
hundred things that never come into the minds of
others, and sometimes there comes a wonderfully
strange idea. Then, only attend, and you will
find it is true! Every fruit-tree looks, especially
when you observe it as a whole tree, just like the
fruit it bears. Look at the apple-tree, when it is
not extended or pruned, does it not look like the
apple itself? And so the pear-tree, and the
cherry. Observe them attentively, the cherry-tree
has a tall stem like the cherry itself—and so
I think—”</p>

<p>“Ah! what do you think?”</p>

<p>“Do not laugh at me. As the fruit-trees look
like the fruit they bear, so is it, also, with men,
and we instantly see it in their faces; only the
trees have an honorable, honest look, and men can
dissemble. But am I not talking nonsense?”</p>

<p>“No, you have not been goose-herd for nothing,”
said the young man, with strange mingled
emotions. “It is pleasant talking with you. I
would gladly give you a kiss, if I did not fear it
would be wrong.”</p>

<p>Barefoot trembled in every limb. She stooped
to break off a flower, but she left it there.</p>

<p>After a long silence the young man said, “We
shall never see each other again,—therefore it is
better so.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>They went back to the dancing-hall, and danced
again without a word being spoken. When it was
over, he led her to the table, and said, “Now, I
must say farewell! But take breath, and then we
must drink a glass together.”</p>

<p>He gave her the glass, but she put it down untasted,
and he said,—“You must drink it for my
sake, to the very last drop.”</p>

<p>Amrie continued drinking, and when at last she
held the empty glass in her hand and looked
round, the stranger had vanished. She went
down to the house door, and there she saw him
not very far off upon his white horse, but he did
not look back.</p>

<p>The evening mist spread like a veil of clouds
over the valley; the sun was already down. Amrie
said aloud, as to herself, “I wish it might never
be morning again,—always to-day, always to-day,”
and she stood lost in dreams. Night came quickly
down. The thin sickle of the moon stood just
above the mountain, and not far from it, towards
Holdenbrunn, the evening star. One Berner
wagon after the other drove off. Barefoot stood
by that of her family which was getting ready.
Then Rose came out and said to her brother, “that
she had promised the young men and maidens
from their village to walk back with them, and of
course it is well understood that a farmer and his
maid-servant cannot go home together.” The
Berner wagon rattled by. Rose must have seen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
Barefoot, but she made believe not to observe her,
and Amrie walked on the way the stranger had
ridden. “Where is he now?” she thought. “How
many hundred villages and hamlets lie in this
direction, and who can say where he has gone?”</p>

<p>Amrie found the place where early in the morning
he had greeted her. She repeated aloud the
question and answer that had passed between
them. She sat again behind the hazel-hedge,
where in the morning she had slept and dreamed.
A golden-hammer sat upon a slender spray, and the
six notes of her song sounded exactly, “What do
you still do there? What do you still do there?”
Barefoot had to-day lived a whole life through.
Had it, indeed, been only one day?</p>

<p>She turned back to the village, but did not go
up to the dancing-hall again. Now she took the
road again homewards by the Holdenbrunn; but
when half way, she suddenly turned back again.
It seemed as though she could not tear herself
away from the place where she had been so happy;
and to excuse herself, she said, “It was not safe for
her to go home alone; and she would join some
of the girls and young men of her village.” As
she came before the alehouse in Endringen, many
from their village were collected; but they merely
greeted her with,—</p>

<p>“So, it is you, Barefoot?”</p>

<p>There was running backwards and forwards,
and many who had been in a hurry to get home,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
returned to dance once more. Young men from
other villages came up, and begged and pressed
for only one more dance. Barefoot returned with
the rest, but only to look on. At last it was agreed,
that those who wished to continue dancing should
be left behind.</p>

<p>Not without much trouble, the Holdenbrunner
troop were collected before the door of the house.
A part of the musicians agreed to go with them
to the end of the village. Many a sleepy father
of a family was drawn to the window by the
music; here and there came a married playmate,
who went no longer to dances, looking out to wish
them “Good luck on the way.”</p>

<p>The night was dark; they had taken long pine-branches
as torches, and the young fellows who
bore them danced backwards and forwards with
them. Scarcely had they gone a few steps, after
the music left them, than they cried out, “that the
torches dazzled and confused them,” and they were
extinguished in a ditch. Now several, both men
and women, were missed, and when they were
called, answered from a distance. Rose was followed
by the son of Farmer Kappel from Lauterbach,
and scarcely had her companions joined her,
when she cried out, “that she would have nothing
to do with them.” Some of the young men began
to sing, and others joined in, but there was no true
harmony. Many jokes were made by the grandson
of the Plaster-grinder Monika, of which the young<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
tailor’s apprentice was the principal butt. At
length they began singing again, this time in
unison, and it sounded full and clear.</p>

<p>Barefoot was always a good distance behind her
village companions; they suffered her to be alone,
and that was the best they could do for her. She
was with them, and yet not of them; and as she
looked often around upon the fields and woods,
how wonderful in the dark was the change. The
night is so strange, and yet so confidential. The
whole world was as wonderful to her as she had
become to herself. As one step followed another,
she seemed to be drawn along without any volition
of her own; she knew not that she moved. She
only knew that her thoughts ran here and there,
so confusedly, that she could neither overtake nor
follow them. Her cheeks glowed as though every
star in the vault of Heaven were a heat-inspiring
sun, and sent its beams into her heart. At this
moment, as though she had herself begun, and herself
had given the tune, her own villagers sang the
song that came to her lips in the morning,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“There were two lovers in Allgäu,</div>
<div class="verse">They were to each other so dear!</div>
<div class="verse">Alas! to the wars went the youth.</div>
<div class="verse">‘And, dearest, when com’st thou again?’</div>
<div class="verse">‘That can I, love, not to thee say,</div>
<div class="verse">What year, or what day, or what hour.’”</div>
</div></div>

<p>Now a serenade was sung, and Amrie joined in
from the distance,—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

</div></div></div>

<p>They came at length to the village, and one
group after another fell off.</p>

<p>Barefoot remained standing long by her parents’
house, under the service-tree, thinking and dreaming.
She wished she could go in and tell Mariann
every thing; but she gave it up,—“Why disturb
her night’s rest?” Then she went homeward.
The whole village lay buried in sleep.</p>

<p>At length she entered the house. All within
seemed more strange than without,—so strange,
she felt that she could not belong there. “Why
hast thou come home again? What wilt thou do
here?” were the strange questions that seemed
asked in every noise. When the dog barked,
when the stairs creaked, when the cows in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
stall lowed,—in every sound was this question,—“Who
is coming home? What do you do here?”</p>

<p>At last she entered her chamber, and sat quiet
a long time, looking at the light. Suddenly she
seized the light, and placed it before her little
glass, so that she saw her own face. She asked
herself, “Who is this? Thus he must have seen
me. So I must have looked,” was the second
thought. “Yet there must have been something
there to please him,—else why did he look at me
so?” A quiet feeling of satisfaction arose within
her, and this was heightened by the thought, “You
have now been respected as a person; till yesterday
you were always looked upon as the servant
and helper of others. Good-night, Amrie, you
have lived one day?”</p>

<p>But this day must come to an end. Midnight
was over. Amrie laid one piece after the other
of her dress carefully away. “Ah, there is the
music again; listen, how the rocking waltz
sounds!” She opened her window; but there
was no longer music. Its echo was in her ear!
Below, near Mariann’s, the cock began already to
crow. She heard the footsteps of men approaching;
probably some belated home-goer from the
wedding. They sounded so loud in the night.
The young geese began to gabble in their enclosure.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said to herself, “geese sleep only
an hour at a time, by night as well as by day.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
The trees are quiet, motionless. Why is a tree
so wholly different in the night from the day?
Such a close, dark mass, like a giant wrapped in
his mantle. How much motion there still is within
the motionless tree! What a world of life there
is there! Not a breath of wind stirs, and yet there
are drops from the trees. These may be caterpillars
and beetles falling. Ah, a quail calls! It
must be the one in the cage at the Heathcock’s.
She does not know that it is night. And look,
the evening star, which at sundown was deep
under the moon, is now nearer and above the
moon. The more we look at it, the higher it
becomes.”</p>

<p>“Does it know the glances of human beings?
How still! Listen! How the nightingale sings!
Ah, this is a song! so deep, so broad! Can that
be one bird alone?” And now Amrie shivered;
for as the clock struck one, a tile, loosened from
the roof, fell clattering to the ground. She
trembled as she thought of ghosts, but constrained
herself to listen again to the nightingale, till at
length she closed her window. A moth, that
looked like a great flying caterpillar full of wings,
had ventured into the chamber, and fluttered
about the light, gray and frightful. Amrie seized
him at last, and threw him out into the darkness.</p>

<p>She now lays her cap, handkerchief, and jacket
in a drawer, where unconsciously she seized upon
an old school copy-book, preserved there, and read<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
therein, she knew not why, old moral maxims and
sentences.</p>

<p>“How stiff and carefully are they written.”
Yes, she might collect from these leaves that she
once lived in the past, for all her past life seemed
to have vanished.</p>

<p>“Now quickly to bed,” she cried; but, with
her determined carefulness, she smoothed out all
her ribbons, undid every knot with fingers or
needle. Never in her life had she cut a knot,
and now, in her extraordinary excitement, her
usual care and patience did not forsake her.
Every hard and embarrassing knot was patiently
loosed. At last she calmly and carefully extinguished
her lamp, and laid down in bed. But she
found no rest, and springing up again quickly, and
leaning upon the open window, she looked out
into the dark night, where the stars only glimmered.
In chaste modesty she covered her neck
and bosom with both hands.</p>

<p>And now there was within her a moment of
feeling, so wordless, so limitless, and yet so all
embracing; a moment of death, and then of life
in the whole universe, in Eternity!</p>

<p>Yes, in the soul of this poor girl, in her garret,
had opened all there is in an endless life. All
the height and the depth; all the bliss of which
man is capable; and this supernatural moment
asks not, “Who is it that I thus exalt?” for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
the eternal stars shine upon the humblest cottage.</p>

<p>A gust of wind that blew the window-shutters
together waked Amrie. She knew not how she
had got to bed, and now it was day.</p>

<small>AS IT IS IN THE SONG.</small></h2>
</div>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“No fire, no raging heat,</div>
<div class="verse">Like secret love can burn;</div>
<div class="verse">All silent, yet how sweet,</div>
<div class="verse">And to the world unknown.”</div>
</div></div>

<p class="drop-cap">THUS sang Amrie in the morning, standing
before the fire, while all in the house were
yet asleep. The stable-boy, who had risen early to
give the horses their first feed, came into the
kitchen for a coal to light his pipe.</p>

<p>“Why up so early,” he asked, “before the
sparrows begin to twitter?”</p>

<p>“I am mixing a warm draught for the cow in
calf,” answered Barefoot, stirring in meal and
clover, but without looking round.</p>

<p>“I and the upper servant sought you last evening
at the dance, but you could not be found,”
said the boy. “True, you did not want to dance;
you were satisfied to be made a fool of by the
stranger Prince.”</p>

<p>“He was no Prince, nor did he make a fool of
me; and had he done so, I would rather be made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
a fool of by such as he, than to be made wise by
thee or the upper servant.”</p>

<p>“Why did he not tell you who he is?”</p>

<p>“Because I did not ask him,” said Barefoot.
The stable-boy made a coarse joke, and laughed
at himself, for there are certain occasions when
the most simple can be witty.</p>

<p>The cheeks of Barefoot glowed like crimson,
from the double heat of the fire and her own inner
flame.</p>

<p>“I tell you what,” she said, “you know yourself
what you are worth, and I cannot make you
respect yourself; but I can forbid you from having
no respect for me. And now leave the kitchen.
You have nothing to do here; and if you do not
go immediately, I will show you the way out.”</p>

<p>“Will you wake the master?”</p>

<p>“That is not necessary,” said Barefoot, taking
a burning brand from the hearth that scattered
sparks; “go! or I shall mark you.”</p>

<p>The stable-boy sneaked with a forced laugh
away. Barefoot tucked up her dress, and went
with the smoking drink down into the stall.</p>

<p>The cow seemed grateful that she had been
thought of so early in the morning. She lowed,
and left drinking many times to look with gentle,
open eyes at Barefoot.</p>

<p>“Yes, now I shall be questioned and finely
teased,” thought Barefoot; “but what does it
matter?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>Going with the milk-pail to another cow, she
sang,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Turn about, turn about,</div>
<div class="verse">Red spotted cow:</div>
<div class="verse">Who will then milk you,</div>
<div class="verse">When I am away?”</div>
</div></div>

<p>“Foolish stuff!” she added, and scolded herself.
Then she finished her work quietly, and in the
mean time life stirred in the house. Scarcely was
Rose fully awake, when she called for Barefoot,
and blamed her harshly; for Rose had lost a
beautiful neck-ribbon. She declared she gave it
to Amrie to keep for her; and she, in her foolish
eagerness, when the stranger asked her to dance,
had thrown it away with the others.</p>

<p>“Who knows,” she asked, “whether he were
not a thief, who had stolen his horse and his dress;
to-morrow he might be brought in with chains on
his hands. And what a shame it was, that Barefoot
had danced so high and spoken so loud. It
was the first and the last time she would take her
to a dance. Her eyes, indeed, had been shamed
out of her head, when she heard everybody ask,—‘So
she is your servant, is she?’ If the sister-in-law
did not command, and they all must follow
her orders, the goose-herd should instantly quit
the house.”</p>

<p>Barefoot endured every thing calmly. She had
already to-day experienced both extremes of what
she must expect, and had taken the course which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
she intended to hold. If scolded, she silently
shook it off; if joked, she knew how to give back
better jokes than she received. If she had not
always a burning brand at hand, as for the stable-boy,
she had glances and words that served her as
well.</p>

<p>It was impossible to tell Brown Mariann all
that Rose made her suffer; and as she could not
speak in that house, she let her tongue loose, and
at other times blamed Rose with violence. But
quickly she reflected, and said, “Ah! this is not
right. I am as bad as she is, when I take such
words into my mouth.”</p>

<p>Mariann consoled her. “It is brave,” she said,
“to scold thus. Why, when one looks upon a
disgusting object, they must spit, else they will be
ill; and when you hear, or see, or experience
any thing bad, the soul must spit it out, or it will
become wicked itself.” Barefoot could not but
laugh at the wonderful consolation of Brown Mariann.</p>

<p>Day after day passed in the old manner, and
soon the wedding was forgotten, the dance, and all
that happened there, by every one except Barefoot,
who felt perpetual anticipation, which she
could not conquer. It was well that she confided
all her thoughts to Mariann. “I think I must have
sinned in being so excessively happy that day,” she
once said.</p>

<p>“Sinned! against whom?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>“I mean God will punish me for it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, child, what do you mean? God loves us
as his children. Is there a greater joy for parents
than to see their children happy? A father, a
mother, who sees her children dance happily, is
doubly happy. God looked upon you as you
danced so joyfully. Your parents also have seen
you dance, and have rejoiced. Let the living say
what they please. When my John comes back!
Ah, he can dance! But I say nothing. Thou hast
in me a friend who does thee justice. What more
dost thou need?”</p>

<p>The counsel and support of Brown Mariann
were consoling; but Barefoot had not wholly
confided in her; had not told her all. It was
not merely what people said of her that troubled
her; alas, it was no longer true that she could
be satisfied with being once completely happy.
She longed to see again the person who had made
her so; who had completely changed her whole
being; and yet knew nothing more about her.</p>

<p>Yes, Barefoot was completely changed. She
suffered no work to fail; no one could blame her;
but a deep melancholy had taken firm hold of her.
There was another reason for this sadness, which
she could acknowledge before the world. Dami
had not written a single word from America. She
forgot herself so far as one day to say to Brown
Mariann, “The Proverb is not false, that when a
fire burns beneath an empty pot, a poor soul burns<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
also. Under my heart there burns a fire, and my
poor soul burns with it.”</p>

<p>“Why so?”</p>

<p>“That Dami has not written to me,” she said,
deeply blushing. “This waiting is the most
frightful murder of time. Time is never so sadly
destroyed as by expectation. At no hour, at no
minute, can one feel secure. No ground is firm
beneath one; one foot must be always in the air.”</p>

<p>“Oh, child, say not so,” cried Mariann, sorrowfully.
“How can you speak of waiting? Think
of me, how I have waited patiently, and shall wait
till my last hour, and never give it over!”</p>

<p>In the recognition of another’s grief, the complaint
of Barefoot was extinguished in tears; and
she said, “My heart is so heavy, that I think only
of dying. How many thousands of pails of water
must I draw, and how many more Sundays will
there be? Ah, one need not, after all, fret so
much, for life will soon have an end. When Rose
scolds, I think, ‘Well, scold on, we shall both die
soon, and then there will be an end.’ And then
comes over me again such fear! I tremble at the
thought of death, when I lie and think how it will
be when I am dead! I shall hear nothing! I shall
see nothing! These eyes, this ear is dead. Every
thing that is myself will exist no longer. It is day,
and I shall never know it! They will mow, they
will reap, and I shall not be there. Oh, what is
this dying?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>“What wouldst thou have?” asked Mariann.
“Many others have died of more worth than thou.
We must bear it calmly—”</p>

<p>“Hark! the watch cries something.” Thus
Barefoot interrupted her strange complaint; and
she, who now would die, and again would not die
was anxious to learn what the village watcher had
cried.</p>

<p>“Let him cry,” said Mariann, sadly smiling; “he
brings you nothing. Oh, what creatures we are.
How must every one of us seek to crack the hard
nut of life; and at last lay it aside unopened! I
will tell you, Amrie, what is the matter with you.
You are dying with love! Be merry! With how
few is it so well; how few are so happy as to cherish
a true, real love! Take an example from me.
Let hope never die! Do you know who within a
living body is already dead? He who does not
every morning, especially in every spring, think,
‘Now, life first begins with me; now, something
comes which has never happened before.’ You
must yet be happy; you do unconsciously the
work of the righteous. What have you not done
for your brother, for me, for Farmer Rodel, for
every one? But it is well that you do not know
the good you do. He who does good, and is
always praying and thinking of it, and builds a
future upon it, will pray himself right through
heaven, and perhaps on the other side will keep
the geese.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>“That I have done here,” said Amrie, laughing.
“I am quit of it there.”</p>

<p>“An inward voice tells me,” continued the old
woman, “that he who danced with you was no
other than my John. And I will now say to you,
that if he is not already married, he must marry
you. He would always willingly have worn velvet
clothes. I think he is now waiting about the
frontiers till our present King dies, and then he
will come home. How wrong of him that he does
not let me know, when I have such a longing for
him!”</p>

<p>Barefoot shuddered at the undying hope of poor
Mariann, and the tenacity with which she forever
clung to it. Henceforth, she never mentioned the
stranger, but when from any cause she spoke of
hope or of return, she instantly named Dami,
although, secretly, she thought of the stranger.
“He was not beyond the sea, and could come
again or write to her—but alas, he had not even
asked where she dwelt. How many thousand
cities and villages, and solitary farms there are in
the world! Perhaps he is now seeking thee, and
can never find thee. But no—he could ask in
Endringen. How easily could he ask Dominic or
Amelia, and they could give him any information
he sought. But I—I know not where he is. I
can do nothing!”</p>

<p>It was again spring, and Amrie stood by her
flowers in the window, when a bee came flying to
the plants, and sucked from the open calix.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>“Ah! so it is,” thought Amrie, “a woman is
like a plant,—rooted in one place,—she cannot
go and seek,—she must wait, and wait to be
sought.”</p>

<p>Thus sang Barefoot. It was wonderful how all
songs and all music seemed made for her. How
many thousands, out of the depths of their souls,
have sung these songs, and how many thousands
will continue to sing them. You that long, and
at last hold lovingly intwined, a heart with your
own, you hold also intwined all that ever loved or
will ever love.</p>

<small>HE HAS COME.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">BAREFOOT stood, one Sunday afternoon, at
the house door, looking dreamingly into the
vague distance, when the grandson of Charcoal
Mathew came running down the village street, and
nodding to her from a distance, cried,—</p>

<p>“He has come, Barefoot; he has come!”</p>

<p>Barefoot’s knees sank beneath her, and with a
trembling voice she cried, “Where is he,—where?”</p>

<p>“At my grandfather’s, in Moosbrunnenwold.”</p>

<p>“Where? Who? Who sent thee?”</p>

<p>“Thy Dami. He is below in the forest.”</p>

<p>Barefoot was obliged to sit down upon the stone
bench before the house, but only for a minute;
then recovering herself quickly with the words,—“My
Dami! My brother!”</p>

<p>“Yes, Barefoot’s Dami,” said the boy, good-humoredly,
“and he promised me you would give
me a farthing if I brought the message to you.
Now give me one.”</p>

<p>“My Dami will give you three.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>“Oh, no,” said the boy, “he told my grandfather
that he had not a penny.”</p>

<p>“Neither have I any at present, but I will remember
it.”</p>

<p>She went quickly back into the house, and
asked one of the maids to milk the cow in the
evening, in case she did not get home in season,
for she had to go out directly.</p>

<p>With her heart beating, sometimes in contempt
at Dami, sometimes in sadness at his ill luck, then
again in anger that he had come back; and then
she reproached herself that she could meet her
only brother with such emotions. She went
through the fields and down the valley, to the
Moosbrunnenwold. The way to Charcoal Mathew’s
could not be missed, although it turned aside from
the foot-path. The odor of the kiln-burner led
infallibly to it.</p>

<p>How merrily the birds sing in the trees, she
thought, and a sorrowful child of man wanders
beneath them. How melancholy must it be for
Dami to see all this again, and how hard it must be
for him, if he has no other resource, to come home
and depend upon me, and take all that I have.
Other sisters have help from their brothers, and
I——. But I will show thee, Dami, that thou
must now remain where I place thee.</p>

<p>Full of such thoughts, Amrie at last reached the
coal-burner’s. She saw no one except Mathew,
who sat by his hut and smoked a wooden pipe,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
which he held with both hands. A coal-burner is
like his kiln,—he is always smoking.</p>

<p>“Has anybody made a fool of me?” Barefoot
asked herself. “Oh, that were a shame! What
have I done to anybody, that they should put so
miserable a joke upon me?”</p>

<p>With clinched hands and a burning face, she
now stood before Mathew. He scarcely raised
his eyes, much less did he utter a word. So long
as the sun shone he was perfectly dumb; at night
only, when no one could look him in the face, he
began to speak.</p>

<p>Barefoot stared a moment in the face of the
coal-burner, and then asked,—</p>

<p>“Where is my Dami?”</p>

<p>The old man shook his head, as much as to say,
“He did not know.”</p>

<p>Then Amrie asked again, stamping her foot,—</p>

<p>“Is Dami here with you?”</p>

<p>The old man opened his hands, pointing right
and left, and shook his head again, as though he
could not be in either path.</p>

<p>“Who then sent for me,” said Barefoot, more
vehemently. “Pray speak!”</p>

<p>The coal-burner pointed with his thumb to the
side where the foot-path led round the mountain.</p>

<p>“Oh, speak one word,” said Barefoot, now weeping
violently, “only one word. Is my Dami here,
or where is he?”</p>

<p>At last the old man said, “He is there! He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
has gone up the foot-path to meet you,” and then,
as though he had said too much, he pressed his
lips together and went to his kiln.</p>

<p>There stood Amrie, and laughed in derision and
sadness at the simplicity of her poor brother.
“He sends for me, and then cannot remain in the
spot where I could find him. How could he believe
that I should take the foot-path? It will
occur to him now, and he will take the other path;
we shall be running away from each other as in a
fog.”</p>

<p>She sat down upon the stump of a tree. Her
heart throbbed and glowed. The flame could not
break out; it consumed her inwardly. The birds
sang sweetly. The branches in the forest rustled.
Ah, what is all this, if no clear note is returned in
the heart? As if in a dream, Barefoot remembered
how she had once cherished thoughts of
love. “How,” she asked herself,—“how couldst
thou suffer such wishes to arise? Hadst thou not
misery enough in thyself, and in thy brother?”
The thought of this love was to her now like the
recollection of a warm sunny day, in the midst of
winter. We can believe that it was once warm
and sunny, but we can understand it no longer.
She must now learn the misery of waiting, of hope
deferred, standing high upon a summit, where
there is scarcely a hand’s-breadth to support one.
The old misery returns, forever increasing.</p>

<p>She went into the stone hut of the coal-burner;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
there lay a sack scarcely half full, with the name
of her father upon it.</p>

<p>“Oh! how you have been dragged about,” she
said, half aloud. She checked her excitement.
She wished to see what Dami had brought back
with him. “He has at least the good shirts that
I made from the linen I bought of Mariann, and
perhaps there is a present from our uncle in
America; but if he had any thing decent, would
he have gone first to the coal-burner in the forest?
Ah, no! he would have shown himself in the village.”</p>

<p>Barefoot had time for these reflections, for the
sack was truly artistically knotted together. Her
usual skill and patience alone succeeded, at last,
in loosening it. She took out all that was in the
sack, and with an angry glance said to herself,—</p>

<p>“Oh! thou good-for-nothing! There is not a
whole shirt in the sack; and now you can take
your choice, to be called ‘Beggar-man,’ or ‘Rag-man.’”</p>

<p>This was not a good disposition in which, for
the first time, to meet her brother; and this Dami
felt, for he stood waiting at the door of the hut
till she had put every thing back into the sack;
then he stepped up to her, and said, “God bless
thee, Amrie! I bring you nothing but dirty
clothes; but you are neat, and will soon—”</p>

<p>“Oh! dear Dami, how you look!” shrieked
Amrie, and lay upon his breast; but quickly she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
tore herself away, and said,—“In heaven’s name,
you smell of brandy! Oh! have you come to
that?”</p>

<p>“No! Mathew gave me a little spirit of juniper,
for I could no longer stand. It has gone ill with
me, but I am not bad. This you may believe,
although I cannot prove it.”</p>

<p>“I believe you! You would not deceive the
only person there is left to believe you. Oh, how
wild and miserable you look! What a beard you
have got. I cannot suffer that. That must come
off. But you are well? Nothing is the matter
with you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I am well—and will go for a soldier.”</p>

<p>“What you are, and what you will be, that
we will not now consider. Now tell me how it
has fared with you?”</p>

<p>Dami thrust aside with his foot a half-burnt log,
called a useless brand, and said, “Look! exactly
such am I; not wholly burnt to a coal, and yet
no longer sound wood.”</p>

<p>Barefoot reminded him, that he should tell
his story without complaint; and Dami entered
upon a long, long history, amounting to this:—“That
he could not remain with his uncle,
who was hard-hearted and selfish, and his wife
grudged every mouthful that he put into his
mouth; that he left him, and sought work elsewhere;
but that he always experienced more and
more of the selfishness of men. In America they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
could see a man fall into misery, and never look
after him.”</p>

<p>Barefoot could not help smiling, as his relation
always ended in——“And then they threw me
upon the street.” She could not help saying,—</p>

<p>“Yes, that is like you. You always allow
yourself to be thrust aside. You were so as a
child. When you stumbled a little, you let yourself
fall like a log of wood. ‘Out of a stumbler
we must make a hopper.’ From this comes the
Proverb.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> Be cheerful! Do you know what you
must do when people would annoy you?”</p>

<p>“We must go out of the way.”</p>

<p>“No; we must annoy them if we can. It will
always annoy them most, to see us keep an upright
position, and a bold face. You stand before
the world, and say,—‘Treat me well, if you
please, or treat me ill. Kiss me, or beat me,
whichever you please.’ This is easy enough. You
submit to their treatment, and then you pity yourself.
Would I allow any one to send me here or
there, if I did not choose it myself? You must
stand up like a man for yourself. You have been
knocked about in the world long enough. It is
time to show yourself as master of yourself.”</p>

<p>Reproach and advice often appear to the unlucky
like unjust severity. Such appeared to
Dami the words of his sister. It was horrible
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>that she could not look upon him as the most
unfortunate of men. It is the most difficult thing
in the world to give a man confidence in himself.
Most people gain it only after they have been
successful. Dami would not relate another word
to his heartless sister, and it was only later that
she succeeded in gaining a particular account of
all his adventures, and how at last he came back
to the Old World as a stoker on board a steam-vessel.
And now, when she reproached him for
his self-tormenting susceptibility, was she secretly
aware that she was not free from it herself.</p>

<p>Through her almost exclusive intercourse with
Mariann, she had been betrayed into thinking and
speaking too much of herself, and had become
too sad at heart. Now, that she had to raise and
cheer her brother, she unconsciously cheered
herself; for there is this mysterious power in
sympathy, that when we help another, we also
help ourselves.</p>

<p>“We have four strong, healthy hands,” she
said, in conclusion; “and we will see if we cannot
force our way through the world; and to
force one’s way through, is a thousand times better
than to beg one’s way through. Come, Dami!
now come home with me.”</p>

<p>Dami was very unwilling to show himself in
the village; he shrank from the ridicule which
would break out on every side. He wished to
remain concealed. But Barefoot said, “Come,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
go with me through the village on this bright
Sunday afternoon, and let them have their laugh
out. Let them talk, and point, and laugh—then
it will be all over; you will have swallowed the
bitter dose at once, and not drop by drop.”</p>

<p>After long and violent opposition, and when the
silent Mathew had joined his persuasions with Amrie’s,
Dami consented to go; and, in fact, coarse
jokes rained from every side upon “Barefoot’s
Dami,” who, they said, “had taken a pleasure
voyage to America at the expense of the parish.”
Mariann, alone, received him in a friendly manner;
and at the second word, asked him, “Hast thou
heard any thing of my John?”</p>

<p>In the evening Barefoot brought the barber,
who took off his wild beard, and gave him the
smooth face customary in that place.</p>

<p>Early the next morning Dami was summoned to
appear in the Public Hall, and as he trembled, he
knew not why, Amrie promised to follow him there,
although she could not much help him.</p>

<p>The Council gave him notice, that he was expelled
from the place. He had no right to remain
longer where he might become a burthen. How
astonished were the councillors, when Barefoot
arose and said, “Yes, well! you may expel him,
but when? When you can go out to your churchyard,
where our father and our mother lie, and say
to their buried bones, ‘Arise, and go forth with
your child.’ Then you may expel him. You cannot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
turn a child away from the place where his
parents are buried. There he is more than at
home. If it is written a thousand and a thousand
times in your books,” pointing to the bound Registers
upon the table, “it cannot happen; you cannot
do it.”</p>

<p>One of the Council whispered to the schoolmaster,—“Barefoot
has learnt this from dark
Mariann;” and the Sacristan nodded to the Mayor,
and said, “Why do you suffer this? Ring for the
policeman, and send her to the madhouse.”</p>

<p>But the Mayor only smiled, and explained to
Barefoot, that the community had bought itself
free from all expense for Dami, by paying the
greater part of the passage-money for his voyage
to America.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Barefoot. “But where is he then
at home?”</p>

<p>“Where they will take him; but not here. And
for the present nowhere.”</p>

<p>“Nowhere have I a home!” said Dami. He was
almost pleased to be always and still more unfortunate.
Now no one could deny that he was the
most unhappy man in the world. Barefoot would
have striven longer, but she saw that it would be
of no use. The law was against her. She declared
she would work the nails off her fingers,
rather than receive any thing for her brother or
herself from the Parish. And she promised to pay
back what Dami had already received.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>“Shall I make a record of that also?” asked the
Secretary of the Council.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Barefoot, “write it down; for only
what is written has any value here.” She signed
the record. In the mean time Dami was told, that,
as a stranger, he had permission to remain three
days in the village; at the end of that time, if he
had not found some means of support, he would be
expelled; and, if necessary, he would be carried
by force beyond the limits.</p>

<p>Without another word Barefoot left the hall,
taking Dami with her, who wept because she had
constrained him to bear this unnecessary humiliation.
It would have been better to remain in the
forest, and to have been spared the mortification
of being expelled as a stranger from his birthplace.</p>

<p>Barefoot would have answered, that it was better
to know distinctly the worst that could happen,
but she felt that she needed all her strength to
keep herself firm. She, also, was expelled with
her brother, and stood alone before a world that
supported itself by might and law, while she had
nothing to oppose to it but her empty hands.</p>

<p>She held herself firmer than ever. Dami’s unhappiness
and misfortune did not weigh her down,
for thus we are made; when an all-absorbing sorrow
fills the heart, another, however heavy, is
more easily borne, than if it had come alone; and
as Barefoot was oppressed by a secret grief, against<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
which she could make no resistance, she bore herself
more proudly against that which was known.
She gave not a single minute to reverie, but
with strong arms and clinched hands, she asked,
“Where then is the work, even if it be the heaviest,
I will undertake it, if it will only save me and
my brother from dependence and indigence.” She
often thought of going with Dami to Alsatia, to
work in a factory. It was terrible to her, that
they should be obliged to do this, but she would
accustom herself to the thought, and when the
summer was over they would go, and then, “Farewell,
home! We shall be at home with strangers!”</p>

<p>The nearest advocate that both the orphans had
in the place was now powerless. Old Farmer
Rodel was lying dangerously ill, and the night
after the stormy meeting of the Council, he died.
Barefoot and Mariann were those who wept the
most genuine tears at his funeral. On their return
home, the old woman mentioned as especial
reason for her tears,—“He was the last among
the living, who danced with me in my youthful
days. My last partner is now dead.”</p>

<p>Soon after she held a different opinion of him,
for it appeared that Rodel, who for long years had
consoled Barefoot with the promise of remembering
her in his will, so far from leaving her any
thing, he did not even mention her. As Mariann
would not cease scolding about it, Amrie said to
her,—“It is all the same, misfortunes never come<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
single. They hail now from every side upon me,
but the sun will surely shine again.”</p>

<p>The heirs of Farmer Rodel presented Barefoot
with some of his old clothes. She would gladly
have refused them. But could she now venture
to show more pride? Dami, also, refused the old
clothes, but was obliged to yield. It seemed to be
his fate, to spend his life in the clothes of the
departed.</p>

<p>Dami found a home with Mathew. The wood-carrier
told him that he should begin a process, for
as he had no home, his silence would be giving up
all right to one. The people made themselves
merry, that the poor orphans had neither time nor
money to begin a lawsuit. Dami was quite happy
in the solitude of the forest. It suited him exactly,
not to be obliged to dress or undress. It
was with the utmost difficulty that Barefoot could
make him wash and dress himself on Sunday afternoons,
when she would sit with him and Mathew.
Little was said by either of them. She could not
prevent her thoughts from wandering about the
world, in search of him who had once, for a whole
long day, made her so happy; indeed, had lifted
her into heaven. “Did he, then, never think of
that, or of her? Can a man forget another, one
with whom he has been so happy?”</p>

<p>One Sunday morning, towards the end of May,
every one had gone to church. It had rained the
day before, and a cool refreshing breath came from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
mountain and valley, while the sun shone brightly.
Barefoot intended to go to church as usual, but she
sat at the window, listening to the church-bells, till
it was too late. This had seldom or never happened
before. But as it was too late for church,
she would remain in her room and read her hymn-book.
She looked over her drawers, and was
surprised at the quantity of things she possessed.
Then she sat upon the floor, and read a hymn, then
sang it, softly. Something moved at the window.
She looked around, and there was a white dove
standing upon the sill, and looking at her. When
the glances of the maiden and the dove met, the
latter flew away, and as Amrie looked after him,
she saw him soar away far over the fields before
he descended to alight.</p>

<p>This little occurrence, which was indeed so natural,
made her instantly happy. Her thoughts
went out over mountain, fields and woods, and the
whole day she was cheerful. She could not say
why, but it seemed as though a new joy opened in
her soul, she knew not whence it came. At noon,
when she leaned against the door, she shook her
head, as she thought of this strange occurrence.
“It must be,” she thought, “it must surely be,
that some one has had good thoughts of me; and
why may it not happen, that a dove should be the
silent messenger to bring them to me? Animals
live in the same world where the thoughts of men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
are floating about, and who knows whether they
are not the bearers of them all?”</p>

<p>Little could the people who saw Amrie, as she
leaned on the door, imagine the strange life passing
within her.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII.<br>

<small>OUT OF A MOTHER’S HEART.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WHILE Barefoot, whether in the village, the
field, or the wood, dreamed, and toiled, and
sorrowed,—sometimes trembling with strange anticipations
of joy, sometimes feeling as though
thrust out from the whole world,—two parents in
another parish were sending out their son, that he
might return to them far richer than he went forth.</p>

<p>In Allgäu, in the hall of the great farm-house
sat the farmer and his wife, with their youngest
son. The farmer began,—“Listen, my son; it is
now more than a year since you returned from
your journey. I know not what happened to you,
but you came home like a whipped hound, and said,
you would rather seek a wife here in this place. I
do not see that you are likely to succeed. Will
you, for once, follow my advice. Afterwards, I
will never say another word.”</p>

<p>“I will,” said the young man, without looking
up.</p>

<p>“Good! try again; once seeking is nothing.
You will make me and your mother happy if you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
take a wife from the place we came from; especially
from where your mother came from; for
I can tell you, wife, to your face, that in the whole
world there are no better women; and if you are
wise, John, you will find one of the right sort;
then, upon our death-bed, you will thank us that
we sent you to our home for a wife. If I could
only go with you, we would soon find the right
one. But I have spoken with our George; he
will go with you if you ask him. Ride over, and
propose it.”</p>

<p>“If I may speak my mind,” said the son, “if
I must go again, I would rather go alone. I am
so made that I could not bear a witness. I could
not advise with any one. If it were possible, I
would rather be unseen and unknown. If there
were two of us, it might as well be cried out by
the town crier, and give them all time to make
themselves up for the occasion.”</p>

<p>“As you please,” said his father, “since such is
your will. One word. Start at once. We want
a mate for our white horse; endeavor to find one,
but not in the market. When you are in the
houses you can inquire, and see for yourself; and,
on your way home, you can purchase a Berner
wagon. Dominic, in Endringen, has three daughters.
Seek one of them. A daughter from that
family would be just right.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said his mother, “Amelia will certainly
have good daughters.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>“And it would be better,” continued the father,
“that you first looked at Amrie of Siebenhöfen.
She has land and money. But that need not be
thy object. However, I will say no more. You
have your eyes in your head. Come, get yourself
ready. I will fill your purse. Two hundred
crown thalers will be enough; but if you need
more, Dominic will lend it to you. Only make
yourself known. I cannot understand why you
did not at the wedding. Something must have
happened there. But I will not inquire about it.”</p>

<p>“Because he won’t tell you,” said the mother,
smiling.</p>

<p>The farmer immediately began to fill the purse
for him. He brought out two large rolls of gold
pieces. If you looked at him, you could see how
pleased he was to let the great coins run from one
hand into the other. He made little heaps of ten
thalers each, and counted them twice and three
times over, so as not to make a mistake.</p>

<p>“Well, be it so,” said the young man, and rose
from his chair. It is the stranger who danced
with Amrie at the wedding in Endringen.</p>

<p>Soon he brings the white horse, already saddled,
from the stable, and straps on his mantle-sack,
while a beautiful wolf-hound sprang up and licked
his hand.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” said the young man, “I will take
you with me.” And now, for the first time, he
appeared cheerful, crying to his father through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
the window, “Father, may I take Lux with
me?”</p>

<p>“Yes, if you will,” sounded from within the
room, together with the clinking of money. The
dog, who appeared to understand the conversation,
began a joyful barking, revolving round and round
in the room.</p>

<p>The young man went in; and while he was
strapping the girdle with the money about him,
he said, “You are right, father, a change will do
me good. I know, indeed, that we should not be
superstitious, but it has done me good already,
that as I went into the stable, the horse turned
towards me and whinnied; and now the dog wants
to go with me. If we could consult animals, who
knows but that they would give us the best advice?”</p>

<p>The mother smiled, but his father said, “Do not
forget to go to Raven Zacky, and do not engage
yourself to any thing without consulting him. He
knows the circumstances of every one for ten
miles round; and is, in fact, a living record of
mortgages. Now, God bless you! You can take
your time, and stay away ten days.”</p>

<p>Father and son shook hands, and his mother
said, “I will go a little way with you.”</p>

<p>The young man led his horse by the bridle,
and walked by his mother’s side, silent, till they
had left the court, and turned into a little side
lane; then the mother said hesitatingly, “I would
give you a few words of advice.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>“Yes, yes, mother, begin at once. I shall willingly
listen.”</p>

<p>She took his hand in hers, and said, “Stand
still, for I cannot talk while walking. Take care,
my son, be sure that she pleases you. This is the
first thing, for without love there is no happiness.
I am an old woman, and may speak without reserve.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes!”</p>

<p>“If you do not think of it with joy; if it is
not to you the first gift of heaven that you may
dare give her a kiss,—then it is not true love!—Stay
a little longer, this is not all; there may
be something concealed—believe me”—the old
lady hesitated, and the color mounted in her
cheeks—“look, if there is not true respect, and if
you have not joy also in this—that a woman does
a thing exactly so—takes a thing in her hand and
lays it down exactly as she does. Observe also
how she treats her inferiors.”</p>

<p>“I understand, mother, and take your meaning
at once. Speaking will tire you. I understand;
she must not be too proud, nor too familiar.”</p>

<p>“That, indeed; but I can understand by the
expression of the mouth whether one is given to
anger and scolding. Ah, if you could only see
her weep with anger, or surprise her in a passion,
she would betray her true disposition. The hidden
temper sometimes shows itself with vultures’
claws, like the spirit of evil itself. Oh, my child,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
I have learnt and experienced much. I can see
by the way she blows out a candle, what her temper
is. She who blows it out with a puff, leaving
sparks and smoke, has a hasty temper, and does
things by halves. She has no true repose of disposition.”</p>

<p>“Ah, mother, how difficult you make it. It is,
after all, and always will remain, a lottery.”</p>

<p>“Yes—you need not be governed by my opinion;
but when you meet with any thing that recalls
my words, you will understand me better.
Observe, whether she talks readily with her work
in hand. If she takes her work when she is sitting
with you, whether she does not leave off work
at every word; and, indeed, if it is not all for show.
Industry is every thing with a woman. My mother
always said a woman should never be with empty
hands; and yet, when she is at work, she must be
calm and steady, and not as though she would tear
a piece out of the world. When she asks a question,
or answers one, remark whether she is timid
or bold. You would not believe it, but girls are
very different when they see a man’s hat, from
what they are among themselves. There are those
who think when you are in the room their tongues
must not be still an instant.”</p>

<p>The young man laughed, and said, “Mother, you
should go about in the world with your sermon,
and have a church for young women alone.”</p>

<p>“Yes! that I might, indeed,” said his mother,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
smiling; “but, naturally, I preach first to you.
Observe particularly how she behaves to her parents,
and brothers and sisters. You are a good
son, and I need say no more. You have learnt the
fifth commandment.”</p>

<p>“Yes, mother, you may be easy on this point.
I have sure signs to judge by. Those who boast
much of their love for their parents, that is nothing.
Love is best shown by actions. Those who
prattle about it are slow enough when it comes to
performance.”</p>

<p>“Ah, yes, you are clever, my son,” said his
mother, laying her hand upon his breast, and looking
into his face. “Shall I go on?”</p>

<p>“Yes, mother, I listen willingly.”</p>

<p>“It seems to me as though to-day I could, for
the first time, speak to you freely; and if I should
die, I will leave nothing forgotten that I would
say. The fifth commandment; yes, it now occurs
to me what my father once said of it. Oh, he understood
every thing, and had read many books.
I once heard him, as he was speaking to the Pastor,
say, ‘I know the reason why a reward is attached
to the fifth commandment alone, where one would
naturally think it unnecessary. But it says,
“Honor your father and mother, that you may
live long.” That does not mean, that a good child
shall live till he is seventy or eighty years old; no,
he who honors father and mother lives long, but
in times past. He lives the life of his parents in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
memory and in thought, which cannot be taken
from him; and whatever his age may be, he has
lived long upon earth. He who does not honor his
father and mother is here but to-day, and is gone
to-morrow.’”</p>

<p>“Mother, there is truth in that. I understand
it, and will not forget to teach it to my children.
But, mother, the longer you speak, the more difficult
it seems to find one that I shall like. She
must be like you.”</p>

<p>“Oh! child, do not be so simple. At nineteen
and twenty I was very different. I was wild and
self-willed, and even now I am not what I should
be. But what was I saying? Yes, of thy wife!
It is strange you should find it so difficult. From
infancy, every thing has been difficult to you. At
two years old, you had scarcely learnt to walk, and
now you can spring like a young colt. Only a trifle
or two more, but from these we often learn great
things. Observe how she laughs,—not a giggle,
neither an affected laugh, but heartily, with her
whole soul. I wish you could know how you laugh
yourself; then you would understand me.”</p>

<p>At this John laughed heartily, and his mother
cried “Ah, yes! That is the way my father
laughed. Just so he shook his shoulders and
sides.” As the mother said this, so much longer
the son laughed, till at last she joined in, and when
one ceased the other began again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>They sat down on a grassy bank, and let the
horse graze. While the mother plucked a daisy,
and played with it in her hand, she said, “Yes, this
is something of consequence. Observe whether
she tends her flowers carefully. There is more in
this than one would believe.”</p>

<p>They heard from a distance maidens singing.
The mother said, “Remark also, whether, in singing,
she willingly takes the second part. It signifies
something when one would always give the
key. Look, there come the school children, and
this reminds me of something. If you can find
out whether she has preserved her writing-books
from her school-days. This is of importance.”</p>

<p>“Yes, mother, I will take the whole world as
witnesses; but what her writing-books have to do
with it, I cannot imagine.”</p>

<p>“That you ask, shows that you have no experience.
A young girl who does not gladly preserve
every thing she has once valued has no true
heart.”</p>

<p>During this conversation, the young man had
been trying to untie a knot in the lash of his whip;
now he took a knife from his pocket and cut it in
two, his mother said, pointing with her finger,
“That you may do, but not a young girl. Observe
whether she cuts a hard knot; there is a secret in
this.”</p>

<p>“That I can guess,” said her son, “but your
shoe-string is untied, and it is time to part.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and now you remind me of something; of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
one of the best signs. Observe whether she treads
evenly, or on one side or the other, and whether
she wears out many shoes.”</p>

<p>“For that, I must run to the shoemaker,” said
her son laughing. “But, mother, all this can never
be found out of another.”</p>

<p>“Ah, yes, I talk too much. You need not remember
all I have said, only when any thing
occurs you may be reminded of it. But, my son,
you know that I have never vexed you with questions;
but now, open your heart to me, and tell
me what happened last year at the wedding, in
Endringen, when you came home like one bewitched,
and have not been like yourself since.
Tell me, perhaps I can help you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, mother, that you cannot; but I will tell
you. I saw one there, who would have been the
right one, but after all she was the wrong one.”</p>

<p>“Ah, God forbid! you did not fall in love with a
married woman?”</p>

<p>“No—but she was yet the wrong one—why
should I say much about it—she was a servant!”</p>

<p>He breathed heavily, and the mother and son
were for some moments silent. At length, his
mother laid her hand upon his shoulder, and said,
“Oh, my son, you are brave, and I thank God who
has made you so. You have done bravely to
drive her out of your mind. Your father never
would have consented, and you would have lost a
father’s blessing.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>“No, mother, I will not make myself out better
than I am. It did not please me that she was a
servant. It would not do, and therefore I came
away. But it has been harder to forget her than
I could have believed. But it is all over now—or
it must be all over. I have promised myself,
that I will not inquire after her. I will not ask who
she is, or where she is. I will bring you, God
willing, a farmer’s daughter.”</p>

<p>“You acted honorably with the young girl?
You did not turn her head?”</p>

<p>“Mother! I give you my hand—I have nothing
to reproach myself with.”</p>

<p>“I believe you,” she said, and pressed his
hand many times. “Now good fortune, and my
blessing go with you.”</p>

<p>The son mounted his horse, and the mother looking
after him cried,—“Hold, I have something
more to say. I have forgotten the best sign.”</p>

<p>The son turned his horse, and said smiling,
“Mother, it must really be the last.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and the best. Ask the young girl about
the poor in the place, and then go round and hear
what the poor have to say of her. A farmer’s
daughter cannot be good for much who has not, at
least, one poor person on hand to whom she can do
good. Inquire about this. And now, my son, ride
on, and God go with you!”</p>

<p>As he rode away, his mother repeated a prayer
in his behalf, and turning again into the court, she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
said, “I should have told him to inquire after the
Josenhans children, and learn what has become of
them.” Who can tell the hidden and secret ways
the spirit wanders; the streams that draw us from
our accustomed paths, or deep beneath them. A
long-forgotten song, a dancing-tune suddenly occurs
to our memory, we cannot sing it aloud, because
the whole is not perfect in our recollection,
but it moves us inwardly, as though we heard it
sung. What is it that thus suddenly awakes this
forgotten melody?</p>

<p>Why did the mother, just then, think of these
children, who had so long vanished from her memory?
Was it the devout sensibility of the moment,
which awoke the remembrance of another long
past emotion, and the circumstances connected
with it? Who can comprehend the invisible elements
that hover around, and connect man with
man, thought with thought?</p>

<p>When the mother came back into the court, the
farmer said jokingly,—“You have no doubt given
him the best instructions how he may select the
best wife, but that I have provided for. I have
written to Raven Zacky, who will show him the
best houses. He must not bring one who comes
empty handed.”</p>

<p>“Money will not make her good,” said the
mother.</p>

<p>“I know as much as that,” said the farmer,
“but why should she not have money and goodness
also?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>His wife was silent, but after a while she said,
“So, you have sent him to Raven Zacky. It was
with Raven Zacky the Josenhans boy was placed.”
This name recalled her former thoughts to her,
and now first was she conscious of recollections to
which she frequently recurred in the course of
the events which followed.</p>

<p>“I know nothing of what you are saying. What
is that child to you?” asked the farmer. “Why
do you not say that I have acted wisely?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, you have been prudent,” said his
wife. But the old man was not satisfied with this
tardy applause, and went out grumbling.</p>

<p>A conscious suspicious fear, that John’s affair
would not succeed, and that they had perhaps
been too hasty, made the old man uneasy, and imparted
his uneasiness to all about him.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV.<br>

<small>THE HORSEMAN.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IN the evening of the same day that John had
ridden forth from Zusmarshofen, Raven Zacky
came to Farmer Rodel’s, and sitting with him in
his back room, read a letter to him in a low
voice.</p>

<p>“A hundred dollars, crown dollars, I must have
when the thing is settled, and promised in writing
too,” said Raven Zacky.</p>

<p>“I should think fifty were enough—that is a
good bit of money.”</p>

<p>“No, not a groschen less than a round hundred—but
then I make you a present of double
the sum; I do it willingly for you and your sister.
I could get in Endringen, or in Siebenhöfen, as
much again. Your Rose is a respectable farmer’s
daughter; that cannot be denied—but for any
thing else they might ask she is not remarkable.
What are a dozen such worth?”</p>

<p>“Be silent—no more of that.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, I will be silent, and not disturb your
writing. Now give me the receipt.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>Farmer Rodel knew whom he had to deal with,
and after he had written he said, “What do you
think; shall I tell Rose about this?”</p>

<p>“Indeed, it were best, but she must not let it
be known to any one in the place. We all have
enemies. You and your sister no less than others.
Take my advice; tell Rose to wear her every-day
dress, and to milk the cows when he is here. I
will introduce him to your house. You have read
what Landfried writes—‘that he has his own
peculiar notions, and would be off at once if he
saw that any preparation had been made for him.’
This very evening, you must send to Lauterbach
for your brother-in-law’s white horse. I will send
the wooer with the broker to look at the horse.
Take care that you do not betray yourself.”</p>

<p>As soon as Raven Zacky had gone, Rodel called
his wife and sister into the back room, and
told them, with strict orders to keep it secret, that
in the morning a suitor would come for Rose; a
man like a prince, who had a farm such as there
was not a second in the country—in one word,
the son of Farmer Landfried of Zusmarshofen.
He then gave them the advice of Raven Zacky,
and recommended the strictest secrecy.</p>

<p>After supper, Rose could not refrain from asking
Barefoot if she would not go with her as a servant
when she was married; she would double her
wages, and then she need not go across the Rhine
to work in a factory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>Barefoot gave an evasive answer, for she was
little inclined to go with Rose. She knew, beside,
that she had some other motive in asking the question.
In the first place, she wanted to show her
triumph, that she had a suitor in view, and then
she wanted Barefoot to take charge of her housekeeping,
with which she troubled herself very
little. Barefoot would have willingly done this for
a mistress she loved, but not for Rose; and if she
once left her present service, she would go into a
factory with her brother.</p>

<p>As Amrie was going to bed, her mistress called
her and intrusted her with the secret, adding, “I
know you have always been patient with Rose;
but now be doubly so, that there may be no noise
in the house while the expected suitor is here.”</p>

<p>“Yes, certainly, but I think it wrong that she
should only this once milk the cows. That will
be deceiving the young man—beside, she cannot
milk.”</p>

<p>“Thou and I—we cannot alter the world,”
said her mistress, “and I think you have trouble
enough of your own. Let others do as they will.”</p>

<p>Barefoot laid down with heavy thoughts, that
people should thus, without conscientious scruples,
deceive each other. She knew not, indeed, who
the deceived might be, but she pitied the poor
young man, and it seemed still worse, when she
thought, “Perhaps Rose will be as much deceived
in him as he is in her.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>In the morning, when Barefoot looked early
from her window, she started back as though she
had suddenly received a blow. “Oh, heavens,
what is that?” She rubbed hastily her eyes, and
looked again—then asked herself whether she
were not dreaming? “Ah, no! there is the horseman
who was at the Endringen wedding. He is
coming to the village! He is coming for me! No,
he does not know me! But he shall know. Ah!
no! no! What am I thinking of? He comes
nearer and nearer! He is here! But he does not
look up!” A full-blown pink falls from Amrie’s
hand over the window-sill, and strikes upon the
mantle-sack of his horse, but he does not see it—it
fell upon the street, and Barefoot hastened down
to recover the treacherous signal. And now the
fearful thought struck her, that he is Rose’s suitor—that
he it is whom she meant last evening. She
did not mention his name, but it can be no other!
None! He is the person to be deceived! In the
stable, upon the green clover which she had gathered
for the cows, she knelt down and prayed fervently
to God, to save him from becoming the husband
of Rose. That he should become her own,
she ventured not the thought; she could not indulge
the hope!</p>

<p>Soon as she had finished milking, she hastened
to Mariann to ask her what she should do. Mariann
was lying severely ill. She had become extremely
deaf, and could scarcely understand a connected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
sentence, and Barefoot could not venture
to shriek the secret which she had partly trusted,
and which the old woman had partly guessed, so
loud that people in the street might hear. Thus
she had to return uncounselled to her home.</p>

<p>She was obliged to go out into the fields, and
stay the whole day, planting. At every step she
hesitated, trembled, and was on the point of going
back to tell the stranger every thing. Yet a feeling
of duty to her employer, as well as calmer
reflection, held her to her task. If he is so inconsiderate
as to act without reflection, then he cannot
be helped; he will deserve no better. Engaged is
not married. With this she consoled herself—but
she was all day uneasy. When she returned in the
evening to milk the cows, Rose sat with a full
bucket before a cow that had already been milked,
and sang in a voice loud and clear, while she heard
the stranger in the neighboring stall consulting the
farmer about a white horse. But whence comes
this white horse? Hitherto they had none. Then
the stranger asked, “Who is that singing?”</p>

<p>“That is my sister,” said the farmer. Hearing
this, Amrie sang the second part, thinking it would
induce the stranger to ask whose was the other
voice? But her singing prevented her from hearing
the question, although he did really ask. As
Rose went with her full pail across the court-yard,
where they were still looking at the horse, the
farmer said, “There—that is my sister. Rose, be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
quick! and see what there is for supper. We have
a relation for a guest. I will soon bring him in.”</p>

<p>“And the little girl who sang so well the second
part,” asked the stranger, “is she, also, your
sister?”</p>

<p>“No, that is only an adopted child. My father
was her guardian.” The farmer very well knew,
that such a benevolent action would give a good
report to a family, and therefore he avoided calling
Barefoot a servant.</p>

<p>She was secretly rejoiced that the stranger had
noticed her. If he is prudent, she justly thought,
he will inquire of me about Rose, and then if the
knot is not tied, he can at least be preserved from
ill fortune.</p>

<p>Rose carried up the supper, and the stranger,
not knowing that he was expected, was much
astonished that so excellent a guest’s repast could
be prepared at such short notice. Rose made excuses,
saying, “He was no doubt accustomed to
much better fare at home.” She imagined, not
unwisely, that any thing complimentary to one’s
home, was always well received.</p>

<p>Barefoot remained in the kitchen to prepare
every thing for Rose’s hand. Again and again
she besought her to say who the stranger was.
“Pray, Rose, tell me who he is? What is his
name?” Rose gave her no answer. At length the
mistress solved the riddle by saying, “You should
know already—it is Farmer Landfried’s son John,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
from Zusmarshofen. Is it not true, Amrie, that you
have a remembrance from his mother?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes!” said Barefoot. She was obliged
to sink down upon the hearth; her knees wholly
failed her; she would otherwise have fallen. How
wonderful was it all! He was the son of her first
benefactress! “Now I must indeed help him,”
she said to herself, “and if the whole village should
stone me for it, I can endure it.”</p>

<p>The stranger went forth; they would have followed
him, but upon the steps he turned again
and said, “My pipe has gone out. I would rather
kindle it myself with a coal in the kitchen.” Rose
pressed in before him, and standing exactly before
Amrie, who sat by the fire, she gave him a coal
with the tongs.</p>

<p>Late in the night when all were asleep, Barefoot
left the house, and ran up and down through the
village, seeking some one whom she could trust to
warn John. But she knew no one. “Hold! There
dwells the Sacristan—but he is an enemy to Farmer
Rodel, and would bring out all the scandal.
Go not to an enemy of thy master, much less of
thy own, and thou hast enemies enough since the
sitting of the parish council about Dami! Ah,
Dami? He can do it. Why not? One man can
speak to another. He can reveal all. Then John—that
is his name—will not forget the service—then
Dami will have an advocate. A good one—a
man—perhaps a whole family. Then he will succeed.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
Ah, no! Dami dare not show himself in
the village. Was he not expelled? But there is
Mathew? He can do it. Perhaps Dami may.”</p>

<p>Thus her thoughts wandered,—swift,—as she
herself ran through the fields, not knowing where;
and it was frightful to her, as it always is to those
who know nothing of the world or of themselves.
She was frightened at every sound; the frogs in
the pond croaked fearfully; the grasshoppers in
the meadow chirped scornfully, and the trees
stood, so black in the dark night. Towards Endringen
there had been a thunder-storm, and flying
clouds hastened across the sky, through which
blinked the stars. Barefoot hastened from the
fields into the forest. She would go to Dami.
She must at least speak with some one. She must
hear a human voice. “How dark it is in the forest!
Was that a bird that twittered? Like the
black-bird when he at evening flies home and
sings, ‘I come, come, come, come home; come
quick, come quick.’ And now the nightingale
struck in—so breathless, so from the inmost heart—welling,
sparkling, softly rippling, like a wood
fountain, that from the deepest source wells forth.”</p>

<p>The longer she wandered, the more she became
involved in the wreaths and sprays that wound
confusedly about her feet in the wood, as her
plans became confused in her head. “No,” she
said at last, “it will come to nothing—you had
better go home.” She turned, but wandered long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
after in the fields. She no longer believed in
wandering lights, “Will-o’-the-wisp,” but to-night
it seemed to her that she was led hither and
thither, and impelled to follow them. She began
to feel that she had been all night barefoot in the
night dew, and that fever burnt in her cheeks.
Bathed in perspiration, she reached at last her bedroom.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV.<br>

<small>BANISHED AND SAVED.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IN the morning when Barefoot awoke, she saw
the necklace which had been given to her by
the wife of Farmer Landfried, John’s mother, lying
upon her bed. After some moments she recollected
that she had taken it out last evening, and looked
at it for a long time. When she attempted to
rise, she found that she could scarcely move. She
felt as though all her limbs were broken. She
clasped her hands together, “Oh, not now!” she
cried. “Oh, God forbid that I should be ill to-day!
I have no time! I cannot be ill to-day!”</p>

<p>As in scorn of her body, and exerting a powerful
will she arose—but when she looked in her little
glass she started back, shocked at looking so ill.
Her whole cheek was swollen. “This is thy punishment,”
she cried, “for running about the fields
all night, and for wishing to take bad men into
thy council.” She struck as for punishment her
painful cheek, and then she bound it up and went
about her work.</p>

<p>When her mistress saw how ill she was, she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
advised her to go to bed again, but Rose scolded
and said, it was only ill-nature in Barefoot to be
ill now, when she knew there was so much for
her to do. Barefoot was silent, but afterwards,
when she was in the stable putting clover in
the rack for her cow, a cheerful voice said,
“Good-morning—so early at work!” It was
his voice.</p>

<p>“Only a little,” she said, and bit her lip with
vexation that she was so disfigured, it would be
impossible for him to recognize her.</p>

<p>Should she make herself known, or should she
wait?</p>

<p>As she was milking, John asked her many
questions. “Whether the cows yielded much
milk, if it was sold, or if they made butter? If
any one in the house kept the accounts, etc.?”</p>

<p>Barefoot trembled. It was now in her power,
merely by only telling the truth, to rid herself
of her rival. But how strangely interwoven are
the threads of our actions! She was ashamed
to speak ill of those with whom she lived, although
it was only of Rose she could say any thing.
The others were good. She knew also, that a
servant should not speak of the interior of the
house. She merely said, “It does not become
a servant, to judge his master’s family; good-hearted
they all are,” she added, with an inward
sense of justice, for, in fact, Rose was so, in spite
of her violent and overbearing temper. Now it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
occurred to her, that if she were to tell him exactly
what Rose was, he would immediately depart.
He would be saved from Rose, but he would be
gone forever. She went on to say, “You appear
to be prudent, as your parents also are, and you
know you cannot form a judgment even of an
animal in one day. I think you should remain a
little longer, and we can learn to know each
other better; and if I can serve you in any way, I
will not fail to do so. I know not, indeed, why
you ask me so many questions.”</p>

<p>“Ah, you are a little rogue, but I like you,”
said John.</p>

<p>Barefoot started, so that the cow drew back
from her, and nearly overturned the milk-pail.</p>

<p>John put his hand in his pocket, but suffered
the money he was going to draw out to fall back
again.</p>

<p>“I will say something more to you,” said
Amrie, as she turned to another cow—“the
Sacristan is an enemy to this family, which you
ought to know, if he should say any thing about
them.”</p>

<p>“Ah, yes, I see. But one may talk safely with
you. You have a swollen face, I see, and your
head bound up; that will do you no good so long
as you go barefoot.”</p>

<p>“I am used to it,” said Barefoot. “But I will
follow your advice. I thank you.”</p>

<p>They heard steps approaching. “We will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
speak to each other again,” said the young man as
he went from the stable.</p>

<p>“Thank you, swelled-cheeks,” cried Amrie after
he had gone, “you have become a mask for me;
under your disguise I can speak to him as they do
in the carnival, without being known.”</p>

<p>It was wonderful how this inward joy had driven
away the fever; she felt weary, inexpressibly
weary, and it was with mingled pleasure and sorrow
that she saw one of the servants getting ready
the Berner wagon, and heard that the farmer was
going away directly with the stranger. She went
into the kitchen, and there heard the farmer
in the next room say, “If you are going to
ride, John, Rose can go with me in the chaise, and
you can ride by the side.”</p>

<p>“Will not your wife go with us?” asked John,
after a pause.</p>

<p>“I have an infant to nurse, and cannot leave it,”
said the wife.</p>

<p>“Nor do I like to go driving round the country
on a week-day,” said Rose.</p>

<p>“Oh, nonsense! When a cousin is here, you
may surely make a holiday,” urged the farmer.
He wished John to be seen with Rose as they
passed by Farmer Furchils, that he might not
cherish any hope for one of his daughters; at the
same time, he knew that a little excursion in the
country would bring the young people more together
than a whole week spent in the house.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
John was silent, and the farmer in his anxiety
touched his shoulder and said, in an undertone,
“Speak to her. If you ask her, she will go.”</p>

<p>“I think,” said John, aloud, “that your sister is
right, not to go driving about the country upon a
week-day. I will put my horse with yours into
the wagon, and we can see how they will go together,
and by supper-time we shall return, if not
before.”</p>

<p>Barefoot, who heard all this, bit her lips to
keep from smiling at what John said. Ah, she
thought, you have not yet put on the halter, to
say nothing of the bridle, by which you would be
led away, no more to return. She was obliged to
take the band from her face; joy made her so
warm.</p>

<p>This was a strange day in the house. Rose related,
half pettishly, the curious questions John
had asked her, and Amrie secretly rejoiced; all
that he wished to know was of things which she
could have answered for in herself. But of what
use was all this? He did know her, and if he
should inquire about her, she was only a poor
orphan and a servant, and nothing could come from
such circumstances. “He does not know thee,”
she said sighing, “and he will not ask.”</p>

<p>In the morning when they both returned, Amrie
had taken the cloth from her brow, although
her chin and temple still retained the broad
bandage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>John appeared to have neither word nor glance
for her. On the contrary, his dog kept close to
her in the kitchen. She fed and stroked him and
said, “Ah, yes, if thou couldst only speak, thou
wouldst tell him all the truth.”</p>

<p>The dog laid his head in her lap, and looked into
her face with soulful eyes; then shook his head, as
though he would say, “It is hard that I cannot
speak God’s truth.”</p>

<p>Barefoot went into the nursery and sang to the
children, who were, indeed, asleep; but she sang
all her songs, and the waltz that she had once
danced with John, she repeated the oftenest.
John listened embarrassed, and betrayed his absence
in his conversation. Rose went into the
chamber and told Amrie to be silent.</p>

<p>Late in the evening, as Barefoot was carrying
water to Mariann, and was near the house of her
parents with the full pail upon her head, John,
who was going to his inn, met her. “Good-evening,”
said Amrie, in a low voice.</p>

<p>“Ei, is it you?” asked John. “Where are you
going with the water?”</p>

<p>“To Mariann.”</p>

<p>“Who then is Mariann?”</p>

<p>“A poor bedridden woman.”</p>

<p>“Why! Rose told me there were no poor in
the village.”</p>

<p>“Only too many. But Rose certainly only said
it, because she thought it a disgrace to the village<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
to have many poor. She is good-natured you
may readily believe, and gives willingly.”</p>

<p>“You are a good advocate. But do not stand
still with that heavy pail. May I go with you?”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“You are right, you are going upon a good
errand, and are protected. Beside, you need not
be afraid of me.”</p>

<p>“I am not afraid of any one, and least so of you.
I have seen to-day that you are good.”</p>

<p>“How so?”</p>

<p>“When you advised me how to get rid of my
swelled face. It has helped me. I now wear
shoes.”</p>

<p>“That is right that you take advice so readily,”
said John much pleased, and the dog appeared to
remark his satisfaction, for he jumped upon Amrie
and licked her hand.</p>

<p>“Come away, Lux,” said John.</p>

<p>“No! let him stay,” said Barefoot, “we are
already good friends. He has been with me in the
kitchen; all dogs love me and my brother.”</p>

<p>“So you have a brother?”</p>

<p>“Yes,—and might I venture to ask a favor of
you; you would earn a reward from heaven, if you
would take him as a servant. He would serve you
faithfully.”</p>

<p>“Where is your brother?”</p>

<p>“There in the forest. He is at present a coal-burner.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>“We have little wood, and, indeed, no coalery.
He would suit me better as a herdsman.”</p>

<p>“That he could easily be. But here is the
house.”</p>

<p>“I will wait till you come out,” said John.</p>

<p>Amrie went in to place the water, lay up the
fire again, and to make Mariann’s bed afresh for
her. When she came out John was waiting for
her, and the dog sprang to meet her. They stood
long together under the service-tree, whose
branches rocked, and whose leaves whispered
above them, and they talked of many things.
John praised her sense and prudence, and at length
said, “If you wished to change your service, you
would just suit my mother.”</p>

<p>“That is the greatest praise a man could give
me,” said Barefoot. “I have already a remembrance
from her.” She related to him the circumstance
that took place in her childhood, and they
both laughed, when she said, “Dami never would
forget that his mother had promised him a pair of
leather breeches.”</p>

<p>“He shall have them,” said John.</p>

<p>They walked back together into the village, and
John gave her his hand when he wished her good-night!
He went reflecting with confused thoughts
to his lodgings in the Heathscock Inn.</p>

<p>Barefoot found, the next morning, that her
swollen cheek had vanished as though under a
charm. Cheerful songs were heard all day through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
house and court, stall and shed. To-day something
must be decided. To-day John must declare himself.
Rodel would not allow his sister to be any
longer the subject of remark, when, perhaps, nothing
might result from it.</p>

<p>Indeed, the whole day, John sat in the house
with Rose, who was sewing upon a man’s shirt.
Towards evening the farmer’s father and mother-in-law
and some other friends came in.</p>

<p>It must be decided!</p>

<p>In the kitchen the roast meat hissed, the pine
wood snapped, and Barefoot’s cheeks burned with
the fire from the hearth, fanned by the deeper heat
of inward burning. Raven Zacky went up and
down, in and out, as though full of business, and
smoked Farmer Rodel’s pipe as though he had been
at home.</p>

<p>“It is then all decided!” Barefoot said to herself
sorrowfully.</p>

<p>It had become night again, and many lights
were burning throughout the house. Rose, gayly
dressed, went from parlor to kitchen, but did not
prepare any thing. An old woman who had formerly
been cook in the city, was hired to get ready
the supper. All was now ready.</p>

<p>The young farmer’s wife said to Barefoot, “Now
go up and put on your Sunday dress.”</p>

<p>“Why should I do so?”</p>

<p>“Because you must wait at table, and you will
get a better present.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>“I had much rather remain in the kitchen.”</p>

<p>“No—do as I bid you—and make haste.”</p>

<p>Amrie went into her chamber, and weary to
death, she threw herself down for a minute upon
her trunk. Oh, she was so weary, so tired, so
discouraged. Could she only fall asleep and never
wake again! But her duty summoned her, and
scarcely had she taken her Sunday dress in her
hand, when joy awoke in her heart, and the glow
from the evening sky which threw a clear beam
into the humble garret room, trembled upon the
heightened color of Amrie’s cheek.</p>

<p>“Put on your Sunday dress.” She had only
one, and that was the dress she had worn at the
wedding in Endringen. Every fold and rustle of
that garment awoke the memory of the dancer,
and the joy she had felt in that dance. But the
night soon sank into the room, and as Amrie fastened
her dress in the darkness, her joy vanished
and timidity returned. She said to herself, “that
as she dressed herself to do honor to John, she
would show that she prized his family also,” and
she put on the necklace, the present from his
mother.</p>

<p>So Amrie came down from her chamber adorned
as she was at the dance in Endringen. Rose
cried, “What is this? Why have you dressed
yourself thus? Why have you put your whole
fortune on your back? Is it a servant who puts
on a necklace? Go, instantly, and take it off.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>“No! that I will not, for his mother gave it to
me when I was a little child, and I wore it when I
danced with him at Endringen.”</p>

<p>They heard a noise upon the steps, but Rose
continued, “So you good-for-nothing creature;
you, who would have perished in rags if we had
not taken pity on you—and now you will take
away my bridegroom from me!”</p>

<p>“Do not call him so before he is,” said Amrie
with a strange, faltering voice; and the old cook
cried from the kitchen, “Barefoot is right, a child
should not be named before he is christened. He
will meet with misfortune else.”</p>

<p>Amrie laughed, and Rose shrieked—“Why do
you laugh?”</p>

<p>“Why should I cry?” said Amrie. “Indeed I
have reason enough; but I will not.”</p>

<p>“Wait, I will show you what you must do,”
shrieked Rose, beside herself—“so—and so.”
She had torn Amrie down to the ground, and
struck her in the face.</p>

<p>“Oh, let me go, let me go!” cried Amrie, “I
will undress myself,”—but Rose without this
promise had stopped, for, like a spectre sprung
from the ground, John stood before her.</p>

<p>He was pale as death—his lips quivered, and
he could not bring out a word. He laid his hand
protectingly upon Barefoot, who was yet upon the
ground.</p>

<p>Amrie was the first who spoke. She cried,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
“John, believe me, she was never so before—never
in her whole life. I am to blame.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you are to blame! But come, go with
me. And wilt thou be mine? Wilt thou? I have
at last found you without seeking for you. And
now you will remain with me. Will you not, and
be my wife? It is God’s will!”</p>

<p>What mortal eye has ever looked steadily upon
the lightning from heaven? Wait for it ever so
firmly, when it comes it blinds the human eye.
There are lightnings also in the eyes of men, that
no one can look upon. Such was the lightning
now from Barefoot’s eyes. There are also emotions
in the human heart that no one can at the
moment understand—they rise far above the
earth, and cannot be caught by others. A lightning
glance of ecstasy, as though heaven opened
upon her, flashed from Amrie’s eyes; then she
covered her face with both hands, and the tears
gushed forth between her fingers. John still held
his hand upon her.</p>

<p>All the friends collected about them, and looked
astonished at what was passing.</p>

<p>“What is the matter there with Barefoot?
What has happened?” said Farmer Rodel, coming
forward.</p>

<p>“So you are called Barefoot,” said John, laughing
merrily; and again he urged, “Come, say only
that you will be mine. Say it here where there
are witnesses who will establish it. Say yes, and
death only shall divide us.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>“Yes—death only shall divide us,” and she
threw herself upon his neck.</p>

<p>“Take her instantly from this house,” shrieked
Rodel, foaming with rage.</p>

<p>“Ah, yes,” said John, “that you need not have
said. But I thank you, cousin, for your hospitality,
which, if you will come to us, we will gladly return.”
Then pressing with both hands his head,
he cried,—“Oh, God—Oh, mother! mother!
How wilt thou rejoice!”</p>

<p>“Go up, Barefoot, instantly, and take away your
trunk. Nothing of yours shall remain another hour
in the house,” said Rodel.</p>

<p>“Yes, but with less noise,” said John. “Come,
Barefoot, I will go up with you. But tell me, what
is your real name.”</p>

<p>“Amrie.”</p>

<p>“I was once to have had an Amrie! Huzza!
Huzza! Come, I will see your chamber—the
chamber where you have lived so long—but soon
you shall have a larger house.”</p>

<p>The dog went round and round Rodel with
bristling, erect hair; no doubt he saw that the
farmer would willingly have throttled his master;
and only when John and Barefoot reached the top
of the stairs did Lux follow them.</p>

<p>John left the trunk, for he could not take it
upon his horse, and packed every thing belonging
to Barefoot in the sack inherited from her father;
she all the time telling him what wonders had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
already occurred in connection with that sack; but
to her, all the world had come together in one moment,
and was a thousand-yeared wonder. She
looked on, astonished, when John seized her
writing-book, preserved from her childhood, and
with joy kissed it, exclaiming, “This will I bring
to my mother; she foresaw this. Ah, there are
yet miracles in the world!”</p>

<p>Barefoot asked no further. Had not all that had
happened to her been a miracle? As she knew
that Rose would instantly tear up her flowers and
throw them into the street, she passed her hand
caressingly over the plants, till she felt it cooled
with the night dew. She went down with John,
and as she was leaving the house, she felt a silent
pressure of her hand in the dark. It was the
farmer’s wife, thus bidding her farewell!</p>

<p>Upon the threshold where she had so often
dreamily leaned, she laid her hand upon the door-post
and said, “May God restore to this house all
the good it has done to me, and forgive, as I do, all
the ill.” But scarcely had she gone a few steps
when she exclaimed, “Oh, dear! I have forgotten
all my shoes. They stood upon an upper shelf.”
The words were hardly out of her mouth, when
the shoes came flying after her upon the street.</p>

<p>“Run in them to the devil,” cried a harsh voice,
which was nevertheless the voice of Rose.</p>

<p>Barefoot gathered up her shoes, while John took
the sack upon his back, and thus they went together<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
to the inn. The moon shone as clear as
day, and the village lay quiet in the moonlight.
Barefoot would not remain in the inn.</p>

<p>“I would much rather go on,” said John.</p>

<p>“I will remain with Mariann,” said Amrie. “It
is my parents’ house, and you will leave your dog
with me. Come, Lux, you will stay with me? I
fear, to-night, they may do me some mischief.”</p>

<p>“I will watch before the house,” said John, “but
it were better that we went on immediately; why
would you remain here?”</p>

<p>“Oh! above all, I must go to Mariann. She has
been a mother to me, and I have not seen her this
whole day. I have done nothing for her to-day,
and she is very ill. Ah, it is cruel that I must
leave her all alone! But what can I do? come
with me to her.”</p>

<p>They went hand in hand together, through the
sleeping moonshine. Not many steps from her
parents’ house, Amrie stood still and said, “Look!
here thy mother gave me the necklace and a
kiss.”</p>

<p>“Ah! here is another, and another!” Blessedly
the lovers embraced each other. The service-tree
rustled all its leaves above them, and from the
forest the nightingales’ sweetest tones joined in
the harmony.</p>

<p>“Ah! that is enough. Now you must go with
me to Mariann. Oh, how she will rejoice, as from
the seventh heaven!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>They went into the house together. When
Amrie opened the door of the room, the moonbeam
as the sun once before shone upon the head
of the angel upon the stove, and it appeared to
smile upon them. Barefoot cried with loud joyful
voice: “Mariann! Mariann! Wake up! Here
is joy—blessing and joy—Wake up! Wake
up!”</p>

<p>The old woman arose in her bed. The moonbeam
fell upon her face and neck. She opened
her eyes wide and asked, “What is it? What is
it? Who calls?”</p>

<p>“Rejoice, rejoice! I bring you my John!”</p>

<p>“My John,” shrieked the old woman. “My
John! Oh, God, my son? How long—how long!
I have thee! I have thee! I thank thee, oh! my
God! A thousand and a thousand times! Oh, my
child, I see thee at last! I see thee with a thousand
eyes, a thousand times over! There, there
thy hand! Come close, come close! There in
that chest is thy portion! Take my hand! My
son! My son! Yes, yes—it is my son! John,
my son, my dear son!” She laughed convulsively,
and fell back in her bed. Amrie and
John had been kneeling at her bedside, and as
they rose and bent over her, the old woman
breathed no more.</p>

<p>“Oh, God, she is dead! Joy has killed her,”
cried Amrie. “She took thee for her own son.
She died happy, then! God be praised! Oh, how
every thing goes! All in this world!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>She sank down by the bed and wept and sobbed
bitterly. At length John raised her up, and Barefoot
closed the eyes of the dead. They stood long,
silently together, by the bed. Then Amrie said,
“I will wake some one in the village to watch by
her. How good God has been. She had no one
to take care of her after I had gone, and God has
given her the greatest joy in her last moment.
Oh, how long she had waited for this joy!”</p>

<p>“Yes! But now you can stay here no longer,”
said John. “Now you will come with me, and we
will go on immediately.”</p>

<p>Barefoot waked the wife of the Sacristan, and
sent her to Mariann. She was herself so wonderfully
self-possessed, that she charged the woman
to have Mariann’s flowers planted upon her grave,
and not to forget to place her hymn-book, and that
of her son, beneath her head, as Amrie had always
promised her.</p>

<p>As at last every thing was placed in order, she
turned to John and said, “Now all is ready, but
forgive me, thou good soul, that I have brought
you to this miserable scene, and forgive me also,
that I am now so sad. I see that it is all good, and
that God has done all for the best, but the shock
is yet in all my limbs. I tremble from head to
foot—for death is a frightful thing. You would
not believe how much my thoughts and my fears
have dwelt upon it. But now it is all well. I
shall soon again be cheerful, for am I not the happiest
bride on earth?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>“Yes, you are right!” said John. “But come,
now we will go. Will you sit with me upon the
horse?”</p>

<p>“Yes, is it the white horse that you rode at
Endringen?”</p>

<p>“Certainly—the same.”</p>

<p>“And, oh, for Farmer Rodel. Did you know he
sent to Lauterbach for a white horse, to induce you
to come to the house? Gee, whoa! White horse,
go again home!” she cried, almost cheerful again.
And so from thought and emotion, they returned
again to common every-day life, and learnt again
to know and feel the blessedness of their lot!</p>

<small>SILVER TROT.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“IS it true? Is it not a dream? Are we together,
and awake, and will the morning come again,
and then the day, and so on forever?” Thus
spoke Barefoot to Lux, who remained by her side
while John was in the stable saddling the horse.
He came out, put the sack upon the horse, and
said, “I will sit upon it, and you shall sit before
me on the saddle.”</p>

<p>“Let me rather sit upon my sack.”</p>

<p>“If it please you.”</p>

<p>Having swung himself upon the saddle, he said,
“Now put your foot on mine, stand firmly upon it,
and give me both your hands.” She swung herself
lightly up, he raised, and kissing her, said,—“Now
you are in my power, I can do with you
what I please.”</p>

<p>“I do not fear you,” said Barefoot, “and you are
also in my power.”</p>

<p>Silently they rode out of the village. In the
last house a light was burning; there was the sexton’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
wife watching by the dead Mariann. John
suffered Amrie to weep undisturbed. As they
rode across the Holden Meadow, Amrie first spoke.</p>

<p>“Here,” she said, “I once kept the geese, and
here I gave your father water from the spring.
God bless thee, thou wild pear-tree, and you fields
and forests! It seems to me all a dream, and forgive
me, dear John, that I do not rejoice. I cannot
yet, and dare not, when I think that my
friend is lying there dead. It is a sin to rejoice,
and a sin not to rejoice. Do you know, John, what
I say to myself? when a year is past I shall be so
happy—when the year is over, oh! how beautiful
it will be! But no! to-day is beautiful, I will be
happy to-day—it is just. Now, we will ride into
Heaven! Ah, what dreams I have had there upon
the Holder Common; that the cuckoo was perhaps
an enchanted prince, and now I sit upon your horse,
and have become the salt duchess. I know they
joke about it in Holdenbrunn, but I am glad you
called me salt duchess. Do you know the history
of the saying, ‘As dear as salt’?”</p>

<p>“No, what then is it?”</p>

<p>“There was once a king who asked his daughter
one day, ‘How much do you love me?’ and
she answered, ‘I love thee as dear—as dear as
salt.’</p>

<p>“The king said, ‘That is a stupid answer,’ and
was angry at it. Not a long time after the king
gave a great feast, and the daughter contrived that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
all the dishes should come upon the table unsalted.
Of course, nothing tasted well, and the king asked
his daughter, ‘How the dinner came to be so badly
cooked?’</p>

<p>“She said, ‘Because the salt failed; there was
no salt. You see now that I was right when I
said I loved you as dear as salt!’ The king was
satisfied, and to this day we say as dear as salt.</p>

<p>“This story Mariann told me. Alas! she
can never tell me any more. There she lies
dead! Hark! there sings the nightingale. Oh! so
happy! I will think no more of sorrow. I will
be thy salt duchess, John. Yes, I am happy!
Mariann said, ‘God rejoices when people are happy,
as parents are happy to see their children dance
and sing.’ We have danced already; come now,
we will sing. Turn a little to the left in the forest;
we will ride to my brother. Sing, nightingale,
we will sing with you.”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Sweet bird of night! I hear thee sing</div>
<div class="verse">Till soul from life to part, will spring.</div>
<div class="verse">Come nearer, bird! and teach me well</div>
<div class="verse">How love and life together dwell!”</div>
</div></div>

<p>Both sang together all their songs, melancholy
and lively, without ceasing, and Barefoot sang the
second part as well as the first. But most often
they sang the Landler, the waltz they had danced
together three times at Endringen, and whenever
they paused, they told each other how often,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
when they were far off, they had thought of each
other.</p>

<p>John said, “It has been impossible for me to
get that waltz out of my head, for with it you have
always danced there. But I was not willing to
have a servant for my wife, for I must tell you
that I am proud.”</p>

<p>“That is right; I am also proud.”</p>

<p>John now told her how he had struggled with
himself to forget her, and how delightful it was
now, that time was all over. Then he told her he
had been twice to his mother’s native village to
bring home a wife from there; but all in vain, for
since he met her that day at the entrance of
Endringen, his heart had been wholly hers; but as
he heard she was a servant, he would not make
himself known to her.</p>

<p>Barefoot told him how Rose had behaved to her
at the wedding in Endringen, and at that time she
was first wounded at hearing her say, “It is only
our servant!”</p>

<p>After much mutual confidence, John cried, “I
could go mad when I think how different it might
have been. How could I have taken any but
yourself homewards? How could it have been
possible?”</p>

<p>After reflecting some time, Amrie said, in her
considerate manner,—</p>

<p>“Do not think too often how it could have been
different, or so and so, otherwise. As it is, it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
right, and must be right; be it for joy or sorrow.
God has willed it as it is, and now it depends on
us to make it for the best.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said John, “if I shut my eyes and listen to
you, I think I hear my mother; she would have said
exactly these words. Your voice is also like hers.”</p>

<p>“She must be now dreaming of us,” said Barefoot;
“I am sure of it.”</p>

<p>And after her peculiar manner, in the midst of
security, although her life from her infancy had
been filled with the seeds of wonder, she asked:</p>

<p>“How is your horse called?”</p>

<p>“As he looks.”</p>

<p>“That will not do; we must give him another
name. Do you know what? Silver Trot.”</p>

<p>And now to the tune they had danced together,
John sang over and over again the one word “Silver-trot,
silver-trot, silver-trot!” Barefoot sang
it with him, and when they no longer sang words
that had any meaning, their merriment was pure,
full, unlimited; they expressed their inward joy
by outward jubilee, by <i>joddling</i> together, for
there are bell-tones in the soul that have no connected
melody, but include in themselves every
sound of joy; and hover here and there, over and
above us, and rock together the hearts of the living.
Again they found words. John sang,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“My treasure is mine,</div>
<div class="verse">I hold it as firmly</div>
<div class="verse">As the tree holds its branch,</div>
<div class="verse">As the apple its kernel.”</div>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>Then they sang in low, deep tones, this serious
song,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“After grief comes quickly joy—</div>
<div class="verse">And joy takes place of every grief.</div>
<div class="verse">I know a dear, brown little maid,</div>
<div class="verse">She has two dark brown little eyes,</div>
<div class="verse">And to my heart she brings this joy.</div>
<div class="indent3">My own she will be!</div>
<div class="indent3">No other she will bless!</div>
<div class="verse">Thus we shall live in joy and grief</div>
<div class="verse">Till cruel Death divide us both!”</div>
</div></div>

<p>There were pure sounds in the forest, where the
moonbeams played upon the branches and hung
upon the stems, and two joyful human children
emulating and contending with the nightingale.</p>

<p>Not far off, by the charcoal-heap, sat Dami in the
quiet night, listening to the charcoal-burner, who
related to him wonderful histories from past times,
when the trees stood so closely together that a
squirrel could run from the Neckar to the Bodensee,
from tree to tree, without once touching
the ground. Then he told him the history of a
rider upon a white horse, a messenger from the
old heathen gods, who diffused over the earth
beauty and splendor, and poured out joy to men.</p>

<p>There are proverbs and fables that influence the
soul, as looking long into an intense fire affects the
eye. Varied colors play around, are extinguished,
and again break out; but when we turn from the
flame, the night is darker than before.</p>

<p>Thus listened Dami, and thus he looked around,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
while Mathew in a monotonous voice related his
stories. He held in, for down the hill came a
white horse with sweet and pleasant music accompanying
him. “Has the world of wonders come
to us?” Nearer came the horse, and there sat
upon him a wonderful rider, broad and tall, and
apparently with two heads. It came always nearer,
and the music changed to a man’s and a woman’s
voice, crying, “Dami, Dami, Dami!”</p>

<p>Both would have sunk into the ground from
fright; they could not stir, but the horse was
there, and now the strange figure alighted.</p>

<p>“Dami! it is I,” cried Barefoot, and related all
that had happened to her.</p>

<p>Dami had nothing to say, but stroked sometimes
the horse and sometimes the dog, and only nodded
when John told him he would take him for his
dairyman; that he should have the care of thirty
cows, and learn to make butter and cheese.</p>

<p>“That will be coming out of darkness into the
light,” said Barefoot. “We could make a riddle
out of that, Dami.”</p>

<p>At last Dami recovered his speech, “not forgetting
a pair of leather breeches also,” he said.
All laughed, and he declared that John’s mother
had promised him a pair of these breeches.</p>

<p>“In the mean time take my pipe,” said John,—“the
pipe of a brother-in-law,”—and he gave him
his pipe.</p>

<p>“But you will have none for yourself,” Amrie
objected.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>“I no longer need one,” said John.</p>

<p>How happy was Dami, as he sprang into the log-hut
with his silver-mounted pipe; but who would
have believed that he could have made so clever a
joke. After a moment he came back with the hat
and long coat of Mathew on, and a lighted torch in
each hand. With the utmost gravity of tone and
manner, he addressed the betrothed lovers,—</p>

<p>“John, I have brought a couple of torches with
which to light you home. How came you to think
you could take my sister from me? I am her adult
brother; you must receive her from me, and until
I say yes, all goes for nothing.”</p>

<p>Amrie laughed gayly, and John made a formal
request to Dami for the hand of his sister. Dami
would have carried the joke still further, for he
was proud of the part in which he had succeeded
so well; but Amrie knew that he could not be
depended upon, and that he would commit some
folly. She had seen already that he had stretched
his hand more than once towards John’s watch-seals,
and had drawn it back again without touching
them. She spoke, therefore, in a severe tone,
as to a young child,—</p>

<p>“That is enough; you have done well; now let
it pass.”</p>

<p>Dami assumed again his own character, and said
to John, “It is all right you have a steel-bound
wife, and I a silver-bound pipe.” As nobody
laughed, he added,—“Ah, brother-in-law, you did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
not know that you had so wise a relation. What
say you, brother-in-law? We are both of one stock,
brother.” It seemed in his joy that he could not
say brother-in-law too often.</p>

<p>At length they mounted, and when they had ridden
a short distance, Dami called after them,—</p>

<p>“Brother, don’t forget my leather breeches!”
Merry laughter answered him, and then again the
music of their songs, as the lovers rode on in the
moonlight.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVII.<br>

<small>OVER MOUNTAIN AND VALLEY.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THERE is no living an equal, uniform life.
Night and day, rest and motion, wild tumult
and stagnant repose, and all the changes of the
season; thus it is in the life of nature; thus it is
in the human heart, and it is well for that heart, if
in all its changes, it does not wander from its true
path.</p>

<p>It was broad daylight when the lovers reached
the town. A long time before, when they first met
a person walking, they both dismounted; they felt
that their appearance was singular, and that first
man, a messenger from memory, reminded them
that they must come out of Eden and assume
again the order of humanity and custom. John
led the horse in one hand, and gave the other to
Amrie, and thus they silently entered the town.
When they looked at each other, their faces shone
like those of children just awaked from sleep, but
when they looked away, or down upon themselves,
they were anxious about what should next occur.</p>

<p>As though she had already talked with John,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
and he had prudently reflected upon the subject,
Amrie said,—</p>

<p>“Indeed, it would have been wiser if we had
calmly arranged matters beforehand. If you had
gone home, and I, in the mean time, had remained
somewhere,—if nowhere else, with Mathew the
coal-burner in the forest,—and you had come for
me with your mother, or written to me, and I could
have followed with my Dami. But do you know
what I think?”</p>

<p>“Not quite all that you think.”</p>

<p>“I think regret is the stupidest thing one can
allow to come over him. Do what we may, we
cannot make yesterday to-day. What we did in
the jubilee of our hearts was right, and must remain
right; we must not, now that we are a little
more sober, reproach ourselves for it; we must
now reflect how we can make the future good and
useful to us. You are a sensible man, and you will
see that it is best to consider and tell me every
thing freely. Say what you may, you will not distress
me; but if you conceal any thing from me, it
will distress me sorely. Say, do you repent what
we have done?”</p>

<p>“Can you guess a riddle?” asked John.</p>

<p>“Yes, as a child, I could.”</p>

<p>“Well, now tell me this, it is a simple word.
Take away the first letter and you might as well
lose your head; put it back again, and it is all
right.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>“That is too easy,” said Barefoot. “It is childish;
it is rue and true,” and as the larks began to
sing, they also sang riddle-songs with them. Then
John sang:</p>
<div class="blockquot2">
<p>“Now love! I will give thee to guess,<br>
But if not, I will marry thee, no less.<br>
What is whiter than snow?<br>
What is greener than grass?<br>
What is black as the sloe?<br>
Dost thou guess it? Ah, love,<br>
Will you marry me?”</p>
</div>
<p>Amrie:</p>
<div class="blockquot2">
<p>“The cherry bloom is whiter than snow,<br>
But when it falls off, the green bud’s below.<br>
The fruit’s like the sloe; in beauty it glows,<br>
And I’ll be thy wife, as thou so well knows.”</p>
</div>
<p>John:</p>
<div class="blockquot2">
<p>“What king has no sway?<br>
What servant has no pay?”<br>
</p>
</div>
<p>Amrie:</p>
<div class="blockquot2">
<p>“The king of clubs has no sway;<br>
The dumb waiter has no pay.”<br>
</p>
</div>
<p>John:</p>
<div class="blockquot2">
<p>“There is a fire that has no heat,<br>
There is a knife that has no point.”<br>
</p>
</div>
<p>Amrie:</p>
<div class="blockquot2">
<p>“A painted fire has no heat;<br>
A broken knife has no point.”<br>
</p>
</div>
<p>Suddenly, John snapped his fingers. “Now I
have one,” and he sang,—</p>
<div class="blockquot2">
<p>“What has no head and yet has feet?<br>
What without sugar, still tastes sweet?”</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>Amrie could not guess, and John sang:</p>
<div class="blockquot2">
<p>“Without head, the yard measure has feet;<br>
And the kiss of thy lips is always sweet.”</p>
</div>

<p>They entered the door of the first inn they came
to, and as John called for coffee, Amrie said:</p>

<p>“How beautifully is every thing ordered in this
world! Here are people who have furnished a
house with chairs and tables and benches; in the
kitchen burns the fire, and there is coffee and milk
and sugar, and a beautiful service for the table,
and all for us, as though we had ordered it; then,
as we go further we shall find the same; it is exactly
as in a fairy tale,—‘Table be covered.’”</p>

<p>“But this belongs to it,” said John, taking a
handful of money from his pocket. “Without this
we could get nothing.”</p>

<p>“Ah, yes,” said Amrie, “upon these little wheels
one can roll through the world. But tell me, John,
did you ever in your life taste such good coffee:
and this fresh, white bread! But you have ordered
too much of it; what can we do with it? I can
take the bread with me, but the coffee! Oh! what
a good breakfast it would give many poor persons.
We must leave it, and you must pay for it!”</p>

<p>“That cannot be helped,” said John. “One cannot
calculate so exactly in the world.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, you are right. But I am not accustomed
to the world; you must not take it ill if I
say things that are not clever and sensible.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>“You can easily say that, but you know that
you are clever.”</p>

<p>Amrie rose soon from the table, and as she
stood before the glass, she cried,—</p>

<p>“Oh, dear Heavens! do I look like that? I do
not know myself!”</p>

<p>“But I know you,” said John, “you are Amrie,
and Barefoot, and Salt Duchess, and that is not
all; you will soon have another name; Landfried
is not bad.”</p>

<p>“Oh! can that be? I think sometimes it cannot
be possible.”</p>

<p>“There are some hard boards to bore through,”
said John, “but they do not frighten me. Now lie
down and sleep a little, while I look about for a
Berner wagon; we cannot in the day-time ride on
one horse; beside we need a wagon.”</p>

<p>“I could not sleep, and I must write a letter to
Holdenbrunn; I am strong; and I have enjoyed
much good there; I have also some directions to
give.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well! get it over when I come back.”
John went, and Amrie looked after him with somewhat
troubled thoughts. “There he goes, and yet
he belongs to me. Is it possible? is it true? is he
mine? He does not look back. How proudly
he goes, and the dog goes with him!”</p>

<p>Amrie made a sign to the dog; he came running
back and jumped upon her. As they went
into the house together, she said, “Yes, it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
good, it was right of thee to remain with me, that
I might not be alone; but come in, I must write.”</p>

<p>She wrote a long letter to the Mayor of Holdenbrunn,
thanking the whole parish for what they
had done for her, and promising to take an orphan
child from thence, when she was able. She besought
the Mayor that Mariann’s hymn-book might
be placed beneath her head. When she had sealed
her letter, she pressed her lips upon it, and said,
“Now I have done with all the living in Holdenbrunn.”
But she tore her letter open again, for
she thought it her duty to show John what she
had written.</p>

<p>He was a long time gone, and Amrie blushed
painfully when the landlady said to her,—</p>

<p>“Your husband has probably business in the
town.” To hear John for the first time called her
husband, sank deeply into her heart; she could
not answer, and the hostess looked at her with
astonishment. To escape her curious glances,
Amrie went out and sat down upon a pile of
boards; the dog sat opposite, waiting for John;
she caressed him and looked deeply into his honest
eyes. No animal seeks and bears the steady,
penetrating eye of man, like the dog, but he also at
last turns away.</p>

<p>How full of riddles, and yet also how manifest is
the world!</p>

<p>Amrie went with the dog into the stable, where
the horse was eating. “Yes, dear Silver Trot,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
she said, “enjoy thy breakfast and bring us well
home, and God grant that all may be well!”</p>

<p>It was a long time before John came back;
when at last she saw him, she ran to meet him,
and said,—</p>

<p>“Promise me that if you have business again on
the road, you will take me with you?”</p>

<p>“What! were you afraid? Did you think I
had left you? Ah! what if I had left you sitting
there, and had ridden off?”</p>

<p>Amrie trembled from head to foot. Then she
said very seriously, “You are not witty, and if you
intended by that a joke, it was dreadfully stupid.
I pity you if you said it seriously. You would
have done something very wicked if you would
have ridden away and thought to have left me—you
thought, perhaps, as you had a horse and
money, that you were the master. No! your horse
brought us here together; I consented to come
with you; what would you think if I made such a
joke, and said, ‘What if I left you sitting there!’
I pity you, that you could say it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, you are right!” John answered,—“but
say no more about it.”</p>

<p>“No! when I am offended I must say all that is
in my mind. I know best when to be silent, for it
is you who have offended me. If another had said
any thing that was unjust, I should have turned
from it; but in you I dare not leave a single
shadow unobserved. To joke of our relation to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
each other seems to me as profane as to play with
the crucifix as if it were a doll.”</p>

<p>“Oh, ho! not so bad as that; but it seems you
do not understand a joke.”</p>

<p>“I understand it well, as you will soon learn;
but now no more of this; I have done; it is all
well!”</p>

<p>This little difference showed both of them early,
that with all their loving devotion, they must each
respect the other. Amrie felt that she had been a
little too warm, and John learnt that Amrie’s dependent
condition, and her unbounded confidence
and trust in him, must be no subjects of sport.</p>

<p>The few morning clouds soon were scattered by
the penetrating beams of the sun, and Amrie was
as gay as a child, when a pretty, green Berner
wagon came to the door, with a round, cushioned
seat. Before the horse was harnessed, she jumped
in, and clapping her hands for joy, she said to
John,—</p>

<p>“Now you must make me fly; I have ridden
with you, I am going to drive with you, and nothing
remains but to fly.”</p>

<p>It was a beautiful morning, and a well-built
road. The horse found easy work, and the dog
ran before them, barking for joy. After some
time, Amrie said,—</p>

<p>“Only think, John, the hostess took me for
your wife.”</p>

<p>“And so you are, and I shall ask no one’s leave,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
and care not what they say. Thou, Heaven, and
ye larks, and you trees, and fields, and hills,—look,
this is my little wife! When she scolds she
is just as dear as when the most beautiful things
drop out of her mouth. Oh! my mother is a
wise woman! Ah! she knows! She told me
to observe how a woman appeared when she was
angry, for then, all that is within comes out. That
was a dear, sharp, cutting, beautiful, wicked little
thing, that came out to-day when you were angry.
Now I know you, and all the kindred, and I like
them. Oh! thou wide, wide world, I thank you
all,—all in the world; and I ask you, if so long as
you have stood, you have ever seen such a dear
little wife? Huzza! Huzza!”</p>

<p>When they met or passed anybody, John would
cry, “See! this is my wife; look at her!” till
Amrie besought him not to do it—when he said,
“He could not for joy help it. I would call the
whole world to rejoice with me—and I cannot
tell how the men who are at work in the fields, or
who are splitting wood, or doing any thing else,
are not able to know how blessed I am.”</p>

<p>A poor woman came limping after them, and
Amrie seized quickly a pair of her beloved shoes
and threw them to her. The woman looked astonished,
and nodded her thanks. Amrie felt for the
first time in her life, that blessed emotion of giving
away a thing which she valued herself. She never
thought how much she had done for Mariann, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
that she had given her shoes, appeared to her the
first benevolence of her heart. She was more
pleased than the woman who had received the
shoes; she smiled at herself, as though she had a
secret in her soul that made her heart leap for
joy, and when John asked, “What is the matter?
why do you smile like a child in its sleep?” she
said, “Ah! it is all like a dream. I can now
make a present—and am going home in thought
with that old woman, and can see how happy she
will be.”</p>

<p>“That is brave,” said John; “I like to see you
generous.”</p>

<p>“Oh! how can you call it so, to give when
one is happy? It is as though a full glass should
overflow. I would give every thing away. I feel
as you do, that I would call all men to be happy;
I mean, I should like to feast them all. I think I
am sitting at a long table, alone with you, but I
cannot eat, I am satisfied.”</p>

<p>“Ah, that is well,” said John; “but do not
throw away more of your shoes. When I look at
them, I think how many beautiful long years
you will wear them—how many beautiful long
years you will run about in them, till they are worn
out.”</p>

<p>“How came you to think of that? How many
hundred times have I had the same thought,
when I have looked at the shoes; but now tell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
me something of your home, else I shall always
chatter of myself.”</p>

<p>John did that willingly, and while he related,
and Amrie listened with wide-opened eyes, there
always moved throughout it in her imagination,
the happy image of the old woman with the new
shoes. After John had described his family, above
all, he praised the cattle—“They are all so well
fed, so healthy and round, that no drop of water
will stand upon them.”</p>

<p>“I cannot understand,” said Amrie, “how I
can be so rich. When I think of it, it seems as
though I had slept all my life, and had just been
waked. No, no! It cannot be so; I am frightened
when I think of the responsibility I shall feel.
Tell me, will not your mother help me; she is
active yet, I hope? I do not know how I shall
help giving every thing to the poor; but no—that
must not be, for it is not mine.”</p>

<p>“Giving does not make one poor, is a proverb
of my mother’s,” said John.</p>

<p>It is impossible to say with what joy the lovers
went on. Every word they uttered made them
happier. Amrie asked, “Have you swallows at
your house?”</p>

<p>John answered, “Yes,” and added, “that they
had also a stork’s nest upon the housetop.” This
made Amrie completely happy. She imitated the
chattering of the storks, and described, so as to
make John laugh, the grave and earnest expression<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
of the stork, as he stood upon one leg and looked
down into his house.</p>

<p>Was it by agreement, or was it the inward power
of these moments of happiness, that they said nothing;
that they did not appear to think of what lay
before them,—their entrance into the parental
house, till towards evening when they reached the
district in which Zusmarshofen lay. But now as
John began to meet peeple who knew him, greeted
him, and looked at them curiously, he said to
Amrie, “He had thought of two plans, as to the
best way of proceeding. Either he would take
her to his sister, who lived very near (they could
see the church tower of the village behind that
hill), and he would go alone to the house and
make every thing known, or she should go immediately
to his parents and offer herself as a servant.”</p>

<p>Amrie showed her decision and good sense as
they analyzed these proceedings, and the objections
to them. If she went first to the sister, she would
have to win over a person who could, after all, not
decide for them, and who, differing from them,
might imbitter their future intercourse. It would
also leave a report in the neighborhood, that she
had not dared to venture into his house. The second
plan was better, but it went against her whole
soul, to enter his father’s house with a lie on her
tongue. It was true, that his mother, many years
before, had promised to take her into service, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
she could not now be in service, and it would be
as a thief, that she would thus steal into her favor.
Beside, in such a false position, under a mask, as it
were, she could do nothing well. If she were
placing a chair for his father, she should certainly
throw it down, thinking she was deceiving him.
And even if this did not happen, how must she
appear to the other servants, when later they
learnt that the mistress had smuggled herself into
the house as a servant; and worse than all, she
would not be able to speak a single word with
him.</p>

<p>She concluded with these words,—“I have said
all this, because you wished to know my opinion.
When we consider any thing together, I must
speak my mind openly and truly, but at the same
time, whatever you wish, if you say so firmly, I
shall do it, whether I agree with you in opinion
or not. I shall follow you without contradiction
whenever I know your wishes.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, you are right,” said John. “Neither
of those roads was the true one. But we are now
so near that we must decide upon something. Do
you see that opening in the forest upon the mountain,
where there is a little hut, and the cows as
small as beetles? That is our early spring dairy.
There I will place our Dami.”</p>

<p>Amrie exclaimed, astonished, “Ah! where will
not men venture? But that must be good grassland.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>“Yes; but if my father should give the farm to
me, I shall introduce more stall-feeding. It is more
profitable. But old people must remain by old
customs. Ah! what am I tattling about, when we
are so near. Ah! had we only thought sooner.”</p>

<p>“Keep only calm. We must calmly consider
it,” said Amrie. “I have a trace of what to do,
but it is not yet wholly clear.”</p>

<p>“How? What is it?”</p>

<p>“No, you must consider also; perhaps you will
hit upon something. It belongs to you to settle
it. We are both in such embarrassment now, that
we will pause, and perhaps we shall both think of
something.”</p>

<p>“Something already occurs to me,” said John.
“There, in the next house but one, lives a pastor
I am well acquainted with; he will advise us for
the best. Hold! This is better. I will remain
in the valley, by the mill, and you shall go alone
up to the farm to my parents, and tell them all,
exactly, roundly, and fully, as it has happened.
You will immediately gain my mother, and you
are so sensible and discreet, that it will not be
long before you will wind my father round your
finger. This is the best plan. We shall not have
to wait, nor to ask a stranger to come to our help.
Do you agree to this, or will it be too much for
you?”</p>

<p>“This is exactly my thought. Now we have
nothing more to consider. It is settled as though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
it were written down and carried out. And now,
quick work proves the master. Oh, you do not
know what a dear, good, sensible, precious fellow
you are!”</p>

<p>“No, you are the sensible one. But it is all
settled, and we are both but one brave fellow together.
That will we remain. Here, give me
your hand. There! So! This meadow is our
first field. Thank God, little wife, now you are
at home. And, huzza! there is our stork; he flies
home. Stork! stork! Say ‘thank God here is the
new mistress!’ Later I will tell you more. Now,
Amrie, do not be too long up there, and immediately
send some one to the mill. If the stable-boy
is at home, send him; he can spring like a
hare. Now, do you see the house with the stork’s
nest on the roof, and the two barns on the hill, at
the left from the wood? There is a linden before
it. Do you see it?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“That is our house. Now step down. You
cannot miss it now.”</p>

<p>John alighted and helped Amrie from the wagon.
She held the necklace, which she had put in her
pocket, like a rosary, between her folded hands,
and prayed softly. John also took off his hat, and
his lips moved.</p>

<p>Neither spake another word. Amrie went on
before, while John stood a long time leaning
against his horse, and looking after her. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
turned and tried to drive the dog back, who had
followed her. He would not go back, but ran
aside into a field, and followed her again. John
whistled, and then first the animal ran back to
him.</p>

<p>John went to the mill and waited there. They
told him that his father had been there about an
hour before, to wait for him, and had again returned
home. John rejoiced that Amrie would
meet both parents at home. The people at the
mill could not tell what troubled John, that he
should wait there and not say a word. He went
into the house—then out again. He went part
of the way to the farm—then turned back again;
was full of anxiety, counting the steps Amrie had
to take. Now she was at this field, now at that.
Now she had reached the beech-hedge—now she
was speaking with his parents. Thus he thought
and trembled.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII.<br>

<small>THE FIRST FIRE UPON THE HEARTH.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">AMRIE in the mean time went on, lost in
dreamy thoughts. She looked inquiringly
up at the trees that stood so calmly upon the place,
and that will stand, she thought, and look down
upon thee for years; many years, perhaps thy
whole life, and be thy life’s companions! Meanwhile,
what will be thy life’s experience?</p>

<p>Amrie was too old to look for support in the
outward world, and it was long since she had
asked the service-tree for advice. She now tried
to turn her thoughts from all surrounding objects;
and yet she must look at the fields that would soon
be her own, and she could not help thinking of
what was to come; of her entrance and reception,
question and answer; the confusion of a thousand
possibilities whirled around, and the Silver-trot
waltz played itself in her head. She said at last,
half aloud, “What is the use of all this thinking?
When the music plays I must dance, be it hop or
waltz. I know not how I shall move my feet;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
they must go of themselves. I cannot think—I
will not think, that perhaps in an hour I may be
coming this way again, the heart broken in my
body! And yet I must move on, step after step!
Enough! Now let whatever will, come; I am
prepared.”</p>

<p>There was more within than this out-spoken
resolution; she had not, in vain, from her childhood,
solved riddles, and from day to day had to
wrestle with life; the whole power of that, which
through effort she had become, rested quiet and
secure within her mind. Without further question,
as one goes to meet a necessity, calm in her self-possession
she went on with courageous and firm
steps.</p>

<p>She had not gone far when she saw an old man
sitting with a red-thorn stick between his feet, and
his hands and chin resting upon it.</p>

<p>“God bless you,” said Amrie. “Do you enjoy
your rest?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Where are you bound?”</p>

<p>“Up to the farm. Will you go with me? You
can lean on me.”</p>

<p>“Ah! So it is,” laughed the old man. “Thirty
years ago I should have been delighted. Then,
if a pretty girl had said that, I had sprung like a
colt.”</p>

<p>“But I should not have said it to one who could
spring like a colt,” laughed Amrie.</p>

<p>“You are rich,” said the old man, to whom an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
idle conversation, on a warm day, appeared agreeable;
and he took with satisfaction a pinch from
his box.</p>

<p>“Why do you say I am rich?”</p>

<p>“Your teeth are worth ten thousand gulden. I
know many who would give ten thousand gulden to
have them in their mouths.”</p>

<p>“Farewell, I have no time for joking.”</p>

<p>“Wait, I will go with you; but you must not
run off so fast.”</p>

<p>Amrie helped the old man carefully to rise, when
he said, “You are strong.” He had made himself
heavier and more helpless than he really was. On
the way he asked her, “To whom was her errand
at the farm?”</p>

<p>“To the farmer and his wife.”</p>

<p>“And what would you have of them?”</p>

<p>“That I will tell themselves.”</p>

<p>“If you would ask a present, turn immediately
back; the wife would willingly give, but she is
mistress of nothing. The farmer is tough. He
has a ramrod in his neck, and a stiff thumb to
that.”</p>

<p>“I do not want any thing of them, but on the
contrary, I take them something,” said Amrie.</p>

<p>They met an old man with a scythe on his
shoulder, going to the field, and Amrie’s companion
asked him, at the same time winking cunningly,
“Whether the old miser, Farmer Landfried, was at
home?”</p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>“I believe so, but I am not certain,” said the
old man with the scythe; and as he went on, Amrie
saw a certain twinkling in his eyes. She looked
steadily in the face of her companion, and suddenly
she recognized through the fallen features the man
to whom she had once given water to drink upon
the Holder Meadow. “Wait,” she said softly to
herself, “I have caught you,” and aloud, “It is
wrong of you to speak thus of the farmer to a
stranger like myself, that you do not know, and
that may perhaps be a relation of his. What you
say of him may be only slander; and should he
appear close, he certainly has a good heart, and
does not choose to ring the great bell to tell the
good he does. Beside, one who has such good,
honorable children, must be honorable himself. It
may be also, that before the world he makes himself
worse than he is, because it is not worth the
trouble to try to please others; and I am of the
same opinion.”</p>

<p>“You have a good tongue of your own. Where
do you come from?”</p>

<p>“Not from this neighborhood. From about the
Black Forest.”</p>

<p>“What is the place called?”</p>

<p>“Holdenbrunn.”</p>

<p>“Ah! and you came on foot?”</p>

<p>“No, part of the way with the son of your
farmer. He took me up. He is a thoroughly
brave, honest young man.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>“At his age, I also would have brought you
on.”</p>

<p>They had now entered the farm-yard, when the
old man went with Amrie into the house, and
called, “Mother, where are you?”</p>

<p>The mother came out of her chamber. Amrie
trembled, and would gladly have fallen on her
neck; but she could not, she durst not, and the old
man said, with a smothered laugh, “Only think,
wife, here is a girl from Holdenbrunn, and she has
something to say to Farmer Landfried and his
wife, but she will not tell me a word of it. Now
you tell her what my name is.”</p>

<p>“Why, that is the farmer himself,” said his wife;
and, as a sign of welcome, she took his hat and
hung it on the stove-handle.</p>

<p>“Do you see?” said the old man to Amrie.—“Now
you may say all you please.”</p>

<p>“Sit down,” said the mother, and gave Amrie a
chair. Breathing with difficulty she began:</p>

<p>“You may believe me, that no child could think
more of you than I have, both in times past, and
for the last few days. Do you remember Josenhans,
at the fish-pond, where the road turns towards
Endringen?”</p>

<p>“Certainly, certainly,” said both the old people.</p>

<p>“I am Josenhans’ daughter.”</p>

<p>“Well, if it did not seem to me as though I knew
you,” said the farmer’s wife. “Bless you, my
child.” She reached her her hand. “You have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
grown up a strong, fine girl. But tell me what
has brought you so far?”</p>

<p>“She came part of the way with our John,” said
the old man. “He will soon follow.”</p>

<p>His wife was startled. She seemed to anticipate
something, and reminded her husband that
she had thought of the Josenhans children at the
moment John rode away.</p>

<p>“I have a remembrance from both of you,”
said Amrie, and took the necklace and a carefully
folded gold piece from her pocket. “That necklace
you gave me the last time you were in the
place.”</p>

<p>“Ah, you told me you had lost it,” interrupted
the farmer to his wife.</p>

<p>“And there,” continued Amrie, giving him the
gilded groschen, “is the gold piece you presented
me when I kept the geese upon Holder Common,
and gave you water from the spring.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, that is all right,” said the old man.
“But what is all this? What is given you, you
may keep.”</p>

<p>Amrie stood up and said, “I have a request to
make. Suffer me for two minutes to speak freely.
May I?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Why not?”</p>

<p>“Look! Your son John would have brought
me to you as a servant. Formerly I would rather
have served you than another, rather here than
elsewhere; but now, it would have been dishonorable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
in me towards those to whom I wish to be
open and honorable during my whole life long.
I could not come with a lie in my mouth, when all
should be as clear as sunlight. In one word, John
and I have taken each other with our whole hearts’
choice, and he wishes me to be his wife!”</p>

<p>“Ah, ha!” cried the old man, and jumped from
his chair, so that one could see his former helplessness
was put on. “Ah, ha,” he cried again, as
though a twinge of gout seized him. But his wife
held him firmly by the hand and said, “Let her go
on.”</p>

<p>And Amrie continued, “Believe me, I have
sense enough to know that no one can accept a
daughter-in-law from compassion. You might make
me a present; but to make one a daughter-in-law
out of pity! that, no one could do. Neither would
I have it so. I have no money. Yes, I have that
groschen that you gave me on the Holder Common.
I have it yet, because no one would take it
for a groschen,” she said, turning to the farmer who
smiled furtively. “I have absolutely nothing!
And yet more, I have a brother, for whom, though
he is strong and healthy, I must provide. I have
also kept the geese, and have been less considered
than any girl in the village. That is all! No one
can say the smallest thing against my character.
That is again all! In what men receive from God
alone, I would say to any princess, that I placed
myself no hair’s-breadth behind her; ah, if she had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
seven golden crowns upon her head—I should
rather another spoke for me. I speak not willingly
for myself; but my whole life long, I have had to
be the only protector of my character, and I do it
to-day for the last time, when the decision must be
made between my life or death!</p>

<p>“Do not misunderstand me. If you reject me,
I shall go calmly away. I shall do no harm to myself;
neither spring into the water, nor hang myself
on a tree. I shall seek another service, and
thank God that a good man would have had me for
his wife—and will believe that it is God’s will
that it shall not be.” Amrie’s voice trembled, and
her form seemed taller than before. But as she
now sank down she cried, “Examine yourselves.
Ask your deepest consciousness if it be God’s will,
however you decide.”</p>

<p>For a moment neither spoke. At length the old
man said, “You can preach like any parson.” The
mother dried her eyes with her apron and said,
“Why not? Pastors have but one brain and one
heart.”</p>

<p>“As for you,” said the old man contemptuously,
“you are something of a parson yourself. With a
couple of soft speeches they can do what they
please with you.”</p>

<p>“And with you, they will never be able to do
any thing till you die,” said his wife, with spirit.</p>

<p>“See!” stormed the old man. “Do you see, you
saint from the Unterland, you bring fine peace<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
into our house. You have already made my wife
take your part against myself; now, you may
both wait till I am dead—then you may do as you
please.”</p>

<p>“No!” cried Amrie, “that I will never do.
John shall never have me for his wife without
your blessing; much less will I have the sin in
both our hearts, of waiting for your death. I have
scarcely known my parents; I cannot remember
them, but I love them as we love God, whom we
have never seen. And I know what death is.
Last night I closed the eyes of Brown Mariann,
for whom, during my whole life, I have done what
I could; what she would have me do; but now
that she is dead, I often think how reluctantly I
sometimes did it, and how much more I might
have done for her. It is all over now; she lies
there in her dark bed; I can do nothing more for
her, nor ask her forgiveness. Yes, I know what
death is, and I will not”—</p>

<p>“But I will!” shrieked the old man, and
clinched his fists and ground his teeth. “But I
will!” he cried again. “You shall remain and
belong to us! And now let what will come. Let
them say what they will; you, and you alone, shall
have my John.”</p>

<p>The wife threw her arms about his neck and
embraced him. The old man, unaccustomed to
such demonstration, cried out, “What are you
doing?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>“Giving you a kiss, for you deserve one. You
are better than you would make us believe.”</p>

<p>The old man, who, during the whole time, held
a pinch of snuff between his fingers, which he
would not waste, now took it hastily, and said,
“Just as you like; but there is one younger, and
from her it will taste better. Come here, you disguised
parson.”</p>

<p>“I will come willingly, but call me first by my
name.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but what is your name?”</p>

<p>“That you need not know. You can give me
one of your own choosing; you know which.”</p>

<p>“You are deep! Well, then, my name; come
here, my daughter.”</p>

<p>In answer, Amrie flew to his arms. “And I,
am not I to be consulted?” said the mother in pure
joy, almost beside herself.</p>

<p>The old man took Amrie by the hand, and said,
in a gay sportive tone, “Worthy Catharina, now
named Landfried, will you accept—what is your
real name,” he whispered, “your baptismal name?”</p>

<p>“Amrie.”</p>

<p>“Will you accept,” he continued, addressing his
wife, “Amrie Josenhans, of Holdenbrunn, for your
daughter, and treat her as you do your husband;
never let her say a word, feed her badly, scold
and oppress her—and in short, treat her as one
of the family.”</p>

<p>A total change had come over the old man; he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
seemed to have lost his senses; and while Amrie
remained in the arms of her mother, and could not
tear herself away, he struck his thorn-staff upon
the table, and cried, “Where is that good-for-nothing
boy, John? He hangs his bride about our
necks, while he is roving about the country.”</p>

<p>Amrie, then, loosing herself from her mother,
said, “that the stable-boy should be sent to the
mill, where John was waiting.”</p>

<p>The old man said, “He must at least be left
three hours to gape away the time there as a punishment
for sheltering himself like a coward behind
her apron. When he did come, they would put a
woman’s cap on his head; and, indeed, he was not
wanted, for he felt much inclined to keep the bride
for himself.”</p>

<p>The mother, however, had slipped out, and sent
the swift-footed stable-boy to the mill.</p>

<p>They now thought that Amrie must be hungry.
The mother proposed an omelet, and Amrie begged
that she might be permitted to kindle the first fire
in the house, that was to prepare any thing for
herself, and also cook something for her parents.</p>

<p>They consented, and both the old people went
into the kitchen with her, where she set about
every thing so handily; saw with a glance where
every thing was kept, and had indeed so few questions
to ask, and did her work so quickly and
gracefully, that the old man nudged his wife and
said, “She has it all by heart, and at her fingers’
ends, like the new schoolmaster.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>All three stood before the clear blazing fire,
when John came in. Brighter than the flame
upon the hearth, shone their heart-felt happiness
from the eyes of all. The hearth with its bright
flame was a sacred altar, around which stood four
grateful and happy people.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIX.<br>

<small>SECRET TREASURES.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">AMRIE knew so well how to make herself at
home in the house of John’s parents, that,
on the second day, it seemed as though from her
childhood she had grown up there. The old man
clattered after her, and observed how handily and
neatly she took hold of every thing, and how she
finished her work without haste and without rest.</p>

<p>There are people, who, if they were to do the
smallest thing, to fetch a plate or jug, they disturb
the thoughts of all who are sitting near; they
draw, as it were, all thoughts and glances after
them. Amrie, on the contrary, accomplished
every thing so quietly, that she made others feel
more at ease, and of course more grateful for all
she did for them.</p>

<p>How often had the old farmer scolded, because,
when salt was needed, some one had to get up
from the table to fetch it! Amrie, as soon as the
table-cloth was spread, placed the salt-cellar upon
the table. As the old farmer praised her for it, his
wife said, smiling, “One would think that you now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
for the first time began to live, that nothing had
been salted for you before.” Then John told them
that Amrie was called the Salt Duchess, and related
the story of the king and his daughter.</p>

<p>They had now a happy life together in the house,
in the farm-yard and in the fields. The farmer
said he had not for years tasted food as good as
that prepared by Amrie. He wished for something
three and four times a day, at quite unusual
hours, and she was obliged to sit by and see him
eat.</p>

<p>The mother took Amrie with quiet and secret
satisfaction into the milk-cellar and store-rooms;
afterwards to a gayly painted press, full of napery
and linen, and opening it said, “This is thy dowry.
There is nothing wanting but the shoes. I rejoice
that you have preserved all yours, for I have a
peculiar superstition upon that subject.”</p>

<p>When Amrie inquired how certain things had
been hitherto conducted in the house, she nodded,
and expressed her secret satisfaction only in the
tone of her voice, while her content with Amrie
brought joy to her very heart. As she now gave
over to her much of the housekeeping, she said,
“Child, I must say one thing; if any of the
present arrangements do not please you, alter
them according to your own judgment, for I am
not one of those who think that every thing must
remain as it has been, and that no improvement is
possible. You have a free hand, and I shall rejoice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
to see fresh aid to the farm; but if you
will take my advice, it will be to do good by degrees.”</p>

<p>That was a happy state of things, when both
mentally and bodily youthful strength went hand
in hand with old preserved experience. At the
same time Amrie, from the bottom of her heart,
declared that she found every thing in the house
so ordered that she should be too happy, if in her
old age she could give up the house in its present
established order.</p>

<p>“You look far before you,” said the mother,
“but that is well—those who look forward look
also back, and you will not forget me when I am
no longer here.”</p>

<p>Messengers had been sent to the sons of the
house, and to the sons-in-law and their families, to
invite them to Zusmarshofen on the next Sunday,
to consult upon family matters. Since the sending
of these messengers, the old man followed Amrie
continually, and seemed to have something on his
mind which it was difficult for him to express. It
is said that a buried treasure is guarded by a black
monster, and that in the night of Christmas, a blue
flame appears above the spot where the treasure is
buried, which only a Sunday’s child can see; and
he, only, when he can keep himself calm and pure,
can raise the treasure.</p>

<p>One would scarcely believe that in old Farmer
Landfried such a treasure was buried, guarded by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
the two monsters, pride and contempt, and that
Amrie saw the blue hovering flame, and knew how
to recover the buried treasure. It is difficult to
say what influence had impelled the old man to
that moral exertion, to appear in her eyes good
and true minded; especially that he gave himself
so much trouble to please a poor, portionless girl.
To Amrie it was clear that he was not willing his
wife should appear as the just and loving one,
and he bitter and severe, and especially as Amrie
before she knew him had said, “She believed he
would not give himself the trouble to appear
well before others.” This had opened his heart.
Whenever they were alone, he talked so much that
it appeared as though his thoughts had been under
lock and key, and were now for the first time
opened. They were, indeed, like wonderful, old fashioned
coins, old keepsakes, that would not pass now,
that had been stamped upon extraordinary occasions.
Some of them were of pure silver, without
alloy of copper. He could not bring out his treasures
as easily as the mother, when she was talking
with John. His speech was stiff in the joints, but
he always had something to say; he even appeared
to take Amrie’s part against the mother.
“Look!” he would say, “My wife is as good as
the day, but the day is not a week or a year. She
is but a woman. With women it is always April
weather; a woman is but half a man. That I will
maintain, whatever comes of it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>“You give us splendid praise,” said Amrie.</p>

<p>“Yes, it is true,” said the old man, “though I
say it to you. But, as I said, my wife is thoroughly
good—almost too good—it displeases her
if one does not immediately take her advice: she
means so well that she thinks we do not know how
good she is, if we do not imitate her. She cannot
understand that the circumstances are unsuitable
when we do not follow her. One thing remember;
do things in your own way as you think right;
that will please her. You will easily remark that
she does not like to have one appear subject to her.
Should any thing happen to go wrong, do not complain
to your husband; nothing can be worse, than
that a man should stand between his mother and
her daughter-in-law. And the mother says, ‘I am
nothing now; my daughter-in-law governs; even
one’s own children forsake one in her old days.’
And the daughter-in-law says, ‘Now I know what
you are; you let your wife be oppressed.’ I advise
you if any thing of this kind happens, to tell
me in secret, and I will help you. Say nothing to
your husband; he has been a little spoiled by his
mother. Only go on quietly, and come to me.
I am your natural protector, and, indeed, related
to you by a distant connection with your
mother.”</p>

<p>He now sought to connect the different branches
of his family, but he could not find the right
threads, became tangled like a snarled skein<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
of yarn, and concluded with, “You may believe
it upon my word, though I cannot reckon it
aright.”</p>

<p>The time had come when he gave away, not
merely false groschens from his hoards, but it gave
him pleasure to part with good honest money.</p>

<p>One evening he called Amrie to him and said,
“Look, my girl, you are brave and sensible, but
you do not know what men are. My John, indeed,
has a good heart, but it may yet sometimes vex
him that you came to him with nothing of your
own. Here, take this, but let no living soul know
from whence it came; say, that by your industry
you have saved it. Here, take it.” He put into
her hand a stocking well filled with crown dollars,
and added, “I intended he should first receive
them after my death; but it is better so; he will
have it now, and think it came from you. Your
whole history is so strange, so contrary to all probability,
that it may well be possible that you possessed
a secret treasure. Do not forget that there
are two and thirty crown dollars; they are each
worth a groschen more than common dollars. Lock
it well up in the chest where you keep your linen,
and take the key always with you. On Sunday,
when the relations of the family are all collected,
shake them out upon the table.”</p>

<p>Amrie took the stocking very reluctantly and
said, “I am not willing to do this; if it is necessary,
I think John is the person to receive this
money.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>“It is necessary. John, however, may take it;
but still, conceal it quickly. I hear John coming.
Quick, wrap it in your apron. I believe John is
jealous of me.”</p>

<p>They parted hastily from each other. The
same evening the mother took Amrie into the
store-room, and brought an apparently heavy sack
out of a trunk, and said, “Pray untie that string
for me.”</p>

<p>Amrie found it very difficult. “Wait, I will
bring you the scissors; we will cut it.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Amrie, “I would not willingly do
that. Have a little patience, I shall soon untie it.”</p>

<p>The mother smiled, while Amrie, with skilful
fingers, at length untied the hard knot. “That is
brave,” she said; “now look and see what there is
within it.”</p>

<p>Amrie saw gold and silver coins, while the
mother continued, “Look, child, you have worked
a miracle with the farmer. I cannot understand
how it has been done, but you have not wholly
converted him; he still repeats what a pity it is
that you have nothing; and he believes that in
secret you possess a pretty little fortune, and that
you only conceal it from us to try us, and see if we
will accept you with nothing. We will not speak
of this, his secret thought; thus an idea has come
into my mind which I trust is not sinful in the eye
of God. Look, these I have spared and saved in
the six and thirty years we have lived together.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
Part of it is also an inheritance from my mother.
Now take it, and say it is your own; this will
make the farmer happy—especially as he has suspected
something of the kind. Why do you look
so confused? Trust me, when I tell you that you
can do it without the least injustice. I have examined
it upon every side. Now conceal it, and
say not a word to the contrary. Give me no
thanks, not a single word, for it is all one, whether
my child receives it now, or later, and it will give
my husband a life-long joy. Now, fasten it up
again.”</p>

<p>Early the next morning, Amrie told John all that
his parents had said, and all that they had given
her.</p>

<p>John burst into a hearty laugh. “Heaven forgive
me,” he said, “of my mother I could easily
believe this—but from my father! I could never
have dreamed of such a thing. You are a true
witch. The best of it is, that neither of them is to
know what the other has done; each would deceive
the other, and both are deceived, for each
will believe that you really had in secret the
money they each have given you. It is too good!
It is enough to make one die with laughing!”</p>

<p>In the midst of all this joy, there was yet mingled
much anxiety.</p>

<small>FAMILY WAYS.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT is not morality that governs society, but a
hardened form of the same, called custom.</p>

<p>As society now exists, an infringement of morality
is more easily pardoned than a departure from
custom. Happy the time and the people, when
custom and morality will be one and the same!
All differences, great and small, in the mass, and
in private life, have their source in the contradiction
of these two—and the hardened form of custom
soon stamps anew the inward flow of morality
with its own impress and form.</p>

<p>Here, in this little history of humble men, that
the great world would push aside, the same principle
ruled.</p>

<p>The mother, who secretly felt the deepest joy at
the fulfilment of her hopes, was full of anxiety on
account of the opinion of the world.</p>

<p>“You have acted thoughtlessly,” she said to
Amrie, “to come into the house as you did, so
that you cannot be fetched for the wedding. This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
is neither right nor the custom. If I could only
send you away for a little time, or even John, that
all might be done in order.” And to John she
complained, “I think I can already hear the talk
there will be at your hasty marriage—twice asked—and
then all settled! This is as disreputable
people do.”</p>

<p>She soon, however, suffered herself to be persuaded,
and she smiled when John said, “Why,
mother, you formerly studied morals like a parson.
Why, then, should honorable people not do a thing
because dishonorable persons sometimes screen
themselves behind it? Can a single thing be said
against my character?”</p>

<p>“No, your whole life has been good and honorable.”</p>

<p>“Ah, then people must show some confidence
in me, and believe that to be right, which at first
sight may not appear so. I have a right to demand
as much as that. Then, as to how I and
my Amrie came together, was so out of the usual
order, that we might also have our own way of
travelling upon the high road; it certainly was no
bad way. We must have courage, and not be asking
after the opinion of others. The pastor of
Hirlengen once said, ‘That if to-day a prophet
were to arrive, he would have to submit to an
examination as to whether his views were according
to the old established order?’ Now, mother,
if we know that a thing is right, let us carry it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
through, without asking, right or left, the leave of
anybody. Let them wonder for a time; by and by
they will think as we do.”</p>

<p>His mother, no doubt, felt that even the most
unusual event must at length be governed by
the same laws that rule all other things. That
the wedding might pass for a wonder, but not the
wedded life, which must submit to the laws which
govern all things; and she said, “With all these
people, whom you now look upon so lightly, because
you are conscious of your own rectitude,
you will continue to live, and you will expect them
to respect you and your honorable life. That they
may do this, you must give them the best example;
you cannot expect them to make you an exception,
and you cannot run after each of them
and say, ‘If you only knew how it happened, you
would see that it was right.’” John answered,—</p>

<p>“You will soon learn that no one who has seen
my Amrie, even for one hour, will have a word to
say against her.” He knew also a sure way, not
only to pacify his mother, but secretly to delight
her, when he told her that every thing she had
said to him of advice or warning, he had found
brought out in Amrie. She smiled again when
he mentioned the shoes, which, he declared, she
should hear running about for many years to
come.</p>

<p>His mother allowed herself to be quieted.</p>

<p>On Saturday morning, before the family council<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
had assembled, came Dami; but he must immediately
return to Holdenbrunn, to procure the
requisite papers from the Mayor.</p>

<p>That first Sunday was an anxious day at the
Landfried farm. The old people had accepted
Amrie; but how would it be with the family? It
is not easy to enter a family of such respectability,
unless with a carriage and horses, household furniture,
and money, and a large connection to prepare
the way.</p>

<p>There was great driving along the roads from
the Oberland on Sunday morning to Farmer Landfried’s;
there came the brothers and sisters-in-law,
with all their relations. It was said that John had
brought home a wife without consulting parents or
pastor, or that any one had had a word to say
about; and they added, “It must be some beauty
he had picked up behind a hedge.” The horses
in the wagons suffered that day in consequence of
what had taken place at Farmer Landfried’s; they
received many a cut, and if they reared it was
still worse, causing many hard words from the
women who sat in the wagons, who scolded and
wept at such reckless driving.</p>

<p>There was a small wagon-house in the court of
the farm, within which the whole family were collected.
Some of them appeared with high water-boots,
others with hob-nailed shoes. Some wore
three-cornered hats, with the point in front; others
sat there with the broad brim shading their faces.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
The women whispered among themselves, and
winked to their husbands, saying, “We shall know
how to thrust the stranger bird out of the family
nest.” And there were seen bitterly angry smiles,
when it was whispered here and there, that Amrie
had kept the geese.</p>

<p>At length she appeared; but she could not give
any one her hand, as she bore a flask of red wine,
with glasses, and two plates filled with cake and
biscuits; enough for seven hands, had every finger
been a hand. She placed them all so quietly and
gracefully on the table, over which the mother-in-law
had spread a white cloth, that they all looked
on astonished. After she had filled the glasses,
without the least trembling of her hand, she said,
“Our parents have given me the privilege of bidding
you all, from the heart, a true welcome!
Now drink!”</p>

<p>“We are not accustomed to drink in the morning,”
said a heavy man with an immensely large
nose, and spread himself out upon his chair.</p>

<p>“Or we drink only pure water, the wine of the
geese,” said one of the women, when a not wholly
concealed laugh ensued.</p>

<p>Amrie felt the sarcasm deeply, but took no notice
of it. John’s sister was the first who took the
offered glass, and looking at John, said, “God
bless thee;” then she glanced at Amrie, who had
held her the glass. The other women, not to fail
in politeness, followed her example. The men allowed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
themselves to be moved, and for a long time
nothing was heard but the clinking of glasses.</p>

<p>“Your father is right,” said at length the mother
to her daughters, “Amrie looks as though she
were your sister, and yet she more resembles our
Elizabeth, that we lost.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you are no losers,” said the old farmer;
“had Elizabeth lived, she would have had one
portion of my estate.” The mother added, “And
now we have her again.”</p>

<p>The old man hit the sore point, though all had
persuaded themselves that Amrie’s want of family
was the cause of their objection to her. While
she was speaking aside with John’s sister, the old
man said softly to his eldest son, “She does not
look like it, but only think, she has in secret a sack
full of crowns; however, you must not speak of
it.”</p>

<p>This injunction was so well obeyed, that in a few
minutes every one in the room was whispering
about it. John’s sister took credit to herself, that
she had been good to Amrie when she believed
that she had not a farthing.</p>

<p>Meantime, John had disappeared; he now came
back bearing a sack, upon which was written,
“Josenhans of Holdenbrunn.” He emptied the
rich contents of the sack, clinking and rattling,
upon the table, when all were astonished, the father
and mother no less than the others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>So Amrie had really a secret treasure! For
here was much more than either had given her.</p>

<p>Amrie could not venture to look up, and all
praised her unaffected modesty.</p>

<p>By degrees she won over all this family, and
when in the evening they took leave, each said to
her privately, “It was not I who objected to your
want of fortune. I say now, as I always said and
thought, that if you had brought nothing but what
you had on, I could not have wished a better wife
for John, or a better daughter-in-law for our
parents.”</p>

<p>It was, indeed, now all right, when they believed
that Amrie had brought a fortune of her own.</p>

<p>In Allgäu they yet relate how young Farmer
Landfried brought home his wife, and how beautifully
he and his wife danced together at their
wedding, especially a waltz, which they called the
Silver-trot. She had brought the music, they said,
from Unterland.</p>

<p>And Dami? He became one of the most noted
herdsmen in all Allgäu, and he acquired a great
name, for he was sometimes called Vulture Dami,
for having destroyed two broods of vultures, they
having twice carried off the new fallen lambs.
With him the family name of Josenhans died out.
He never married, but was a good uncle to Amrie’s
children—better than the uncle in America
had been to him. In the winter time, when the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
cattle are housed, he tells his sister’s children many
stories of America, and of Mathew in Moosbrunnenwalde,
and of the cattle in the Allgäu Mountains.
Especially he had many clever stories to
tell of his so-called Queen cow, who bore the deep
sounding bell.</p>

<p>Dami said once to his sister, “Dame farmer,”—for
thus he always called her,—“Dame farmer,
your eldest boy is just like you; he said to me
yesterday, ‘Uncle, your Queen cow is your heart’s
cow.’ Yes, that is exactly like you!”</p>

<p>John wished to name his first daughter Barefoot;
but as objection was made to recording this
new name in the Baptismal Register, he had the
little girl christened Barbara, and, to please himself,
changed it to Barefoot.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
